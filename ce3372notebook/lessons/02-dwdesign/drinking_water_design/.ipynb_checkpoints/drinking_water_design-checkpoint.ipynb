    "# Design of Water Supply Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing a **drinking water supply and treatment system** is one of the most complex and rewarding tasks in civil and environmental engineering. A successful design balances **technical performance**, **public health protection**, **cost**, and **sustainability**. Engineers must consider interacting factors such as demand estimation, water source protection, treatment processes, storage capacity, and distribution network configuration to ensure that a community’s water supply remains safe, reliable, and resilient over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The design process is guided by established manuals and standards, including the **American Water Works Association (AWWA)** *Manuals of Practice*, the **Ten States Standards**, and various state or municipal design guides. These resources provide consistent frameworks for planning, design, and construction — covering everything from pipe sizing and pump selection to treatment plant hydraulics and system redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design as the Management of Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Design is the management of constraints** — balancing what must happen with what can happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-negotiable constraints** are dictated by physics, chemistry, and regulation.  \n",
    "  Water flows downhill unless energy is supplied to lift it; disinfectant residuals decay unless replenished; pressure cannot be maintained without sufficient head.  \n",
    "- **Negotiable constraints** are variables engineers can adjust — such as materials, layout, timing, budget, or aesthetics — to achieve performance within those physical limits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the designer’s role is to meet system needs by manipulating the negotiable variables to satisfy the non-negotiable requirements.  \n",
    "Analytical tools and computer models allow engineers to test designs virtually before construction begins — reducing uncertainty, avoiding costly field errors, and ensuring that the final design meets both technical and regulatory standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hydraulic Principles in Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Hydraulics governs how water moves through pipes, pumps, tanks, and treatment processes. Sound hydraulic design ensures that adequate pressure and flow are maintained throughout the system — from the source, through the treatment plant, to the customer’s tap.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flow and Pressure:** Equations such as *Bernoulli’s* and *Manning’s* help determine head loss, pipe sizes, pump capacities, and tank elevations. Typical pressures range from **40–80 psi**.  \n",
    "- **Energy and Grade Lines:** The *Hydraulic Grade Line (HGL)* helps visualize changes in energy along a system. Gravity flow, when possible, minimizes pumping and lowers operating costs.  \n",
    "- **System Optimization:** Modeling software such as **EPANET** or **WaterGEMS** allows simulation of network performance, including transient behavior and water age.\n",
    "\n",
    "In treatment plants, hydraulics ensures that each stage — sedimentation, filtration, or chemical dosing — operates effectively at design flow rates.  \n",
    "Designers also account for **transient effects** such as *water hammer* by using surge tanks, air-release valves, or slow-closing valves to protect system components.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Fundamentals for Water Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "All water system designs begin with four essential questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How much water will be used?**  \n",
    "   Estimate current and future demands, including peak and fire-flow conditions.\n",
    "2. **Where are the supply sources located?**  \n",
    "   Identify groundwater wells, surface intakes, desalination plants, or rainwater systems — each has distinct implications.\n",
    "3. **Where are the consumption points?**  \n",
    "   Map demand centers to determine pressure zones, storage needs, and pump requirements.\n",
    "4. **How does demand vary with time?**  \n",
    "   Analyze diurnal and seasonal variations to size reservoirs and schedule pumping efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Building a modern database of local demand data would make an excellent *data-science project* (ENGR 1330).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transmission and Distribution Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transmission mains** carry large volumes of water from sources or treatment plants to storage facilities.  \n",
    "**Distribution mains** deliver treated water to consumers through smaller interconnected pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree (Branched) Systems:**  \n",
    "  Simple and economical; often used in rural areas but prone to stagnation and service disruption.\n",
    "- **Grid or Loop Systems:**  \n",
    "  Interconnected networks providing better pressure stability, redundancy, and water quality — preferred in most urban designs.\n",
    "- **Arterial Loop Systems:**  \n",
    "  Large backbone mains surrounding the service area, supplying smaller grids from multiple directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note:* Arterial loop and grid systems are functionally similar — terminology varies by locality.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](system-type.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-designed system also includes **appurtenances** — valves, hydrants, blow-offs, and air-release devices — that aid operation and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Guidance and Professional Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Designers rely on three main categories of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Regulatory Documents\n",
    "Federal and state agencies, such as the **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** and state environmental departments, issue regulations governing system design, construction, and operation.  \n",
    "States may adopt more stringent rules than the federal minimums.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Design Manuals\n",
    "Local governments publish design manuals that define acceptable materials, construction practices, and testing procedures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Representative examples:  \n",
    "- [Washington State Water System Design Manual (2018)](http://54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/3-Readings/WashingtonWaterSystemDesignManual2018/WashingtonWaterSystemDesignManual2018.pdf)  \n",

    "> Always use the manual specific to your project’s jurisdiction — requirements and standards are updated frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Professional and Manufacturer Literature\n",
    "For unusual or innovative projects, engineers may consult **manuals of practice**, **vendor specifications**, or **peer-reviewed research**.  \n",
    "Manuals and vendor data are generally preferred over research papers because they reflect proven, field-tested technologies and reduce design risk.\n",

    "\n",
    "Most design manuals devote considerable space to **submittal and approval** requirements for drawings. Within the right-of-way, however, the **physical layout** is largely a hydraulic design choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical early-stage workflow:\n",

It explains the purpose of a project, presents the technical reasoning behind design choices, and documents how the design meets performance, safety, and regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future engineers, learning how to organize and write a clear project report is a valuable professional skill. It combines technical accuracy, logical structure, and clear communication—three traits that distinguish effective engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A project report includes the calculations, assumptions, and design criteria needed to demonstrate that a proposed design will achieve its goals safely and efficiently. Engineers typically prepare the project report before producing detailed construction drawings. The content should reflect accepted engineering practices, and the amount of detail should match the complexity and importance of the project.\n",

    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The project description explains what the project is about and why it is being done. A clear, accurate description helps reviewers understand the project’s purpose, ensures efficient regulatory review, and becomes part of the project’s permanent design record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most project reports should summarize the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the project and the problems it aims to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended design alternative, proposed construction schedule, estimated cost, and funding source.\n",

    "\n",
    "Good planning connects engineering design to real-world needs and regulations. It ensures that the project aligns with community goals, available resources, and long-term system requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no current plan addresses these issues, the project report should include:\n",

    "A Water Rights Assessment, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis of alternatives compares different ways to meet the project objectives. This step helps ensure that the final design is efficient, reliable, and cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects that skip this step often face higher costs, reduced reliability, or compliance problems later. Engineers should match the chosen design to the system’s capabilities—balancing performance, maintainability, and affordability.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Water Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Water quality protection is central to all water system design. Engineers must consider how each design decision affects public health and delivered water quality.\n",

    "A discussion of how the proposed project will maintain or improve quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pilot testing methods, if the project includes treatment or filtration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Designers must think holistically: fixing one water quality issue (such as taste, color, or bacteria) should not create new ones (such as corrosion or disinfection byproducts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of unintended effects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting pH or adding chlorine in ways that increase corrosion and raise lead or copper levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a new source with higher pH that causes iron or manganese precipitation.\n",

    "Construction documents must show how each part of the project will be constructed to meet the requirements and conditions established in the approved project report. Together, they form a legal and technical record of the design intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "All construction documents should follow the standards of professional engineering practice, including accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Approval of construction documents is typically valid only for a limited period (for example, two years). If construction takes longer, the design engineer must request an extension before the approval expires. Regulatory agencies may apply updated design conditions when granting such extensions to ensure the project remains consistent with current standards.\n",

    "# Project Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering projects must be clearly communicated so that others can understand, review, and build upon the work. The project report is the primary way engineers do this. It explains the purpose of a project, presents the technical reasoning behind design choices, and documents how the design meets performance, safety, and regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future engineers, learning how to organize and write a clear project report is a valuable professional skill. It combines technical accuracy, logical structure, and clear communication—three traits that distinguish effective engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A project report includes the calculations, assumptions, and design criteria needed to demonstrate that a proposed design will achieve its goals safely and efficiently. Engineers typically prepare the project report before producing detailed construction drawings. The content should reflect accepted engineering practices, and the amount of detail should match the complexity and importance of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces the essential components that appear in most project reports. For specific projects, you should always check the relevant design manuals and the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction where the project will be built and operated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The project description explains what the project is about and why it is being done. A clear, accurate description helps reviewers understand the project’s purpose, ensures efficient regulatory review, and becomes part of the project’s permanent design record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most project reports should summarize the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The reason for the project and the problems it aims to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The recommended design alternative, proposed construction schedule, estimated cost, and funding source.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The relationship between this project and other parts of the water system.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How the project will change system capacity or improve service.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Environmental documentation, such as an impact statement or an explanation of why environmental review does not apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Information about source development, if the project involves a new or modified water source.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The type of treatment process proposed, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Good planning connects engineering design to real-world needs and regulations. It ensures that the project aligns with community goals, available resources, and long-term system requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no current plan addresses these issues, the project report should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Background information, including projected population and water demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A service area map showing the retail and general service areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Discussion of how the project may affect neighboring water systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Local requirements, such as minimum fire flow and duration.\n",

    "6. A schedule for project implementation, including major phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Capital and operating cost estimates with potential financing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. A Water Rights Assessment, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis of alternatives compares different ways to meet the project objectives. This step helps ensure that the final design is efficient, reliable, and cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects that skip this step often face higher costs, reduced reliability, or compliance problems later. Engineers should match the chosen design to the system’s capabilities—balancing performance, maintainability, and affordability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common evaluation factors include life-cycle cost, operating reliability, ease of maintenance, and implementation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Water Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Water quality protection is central to all water system design. Engineers must consider how each design decision affects public health and delivered water quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project report should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Results of water quality testing from accredited laboratories, covering both raw and treated water.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A discussion of how the proposed project will maintain or improve quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pilot testing methods, if the project includes treatment or filtration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Designers must think holistically: fixing one water quality issue (such as taste, color, or bacteria) should not create new ones (such as corrosion or disinfection byproducts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of unintended effects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjusting pH or adding chlorine in ways that increase corrosion and raise lead or copper levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding a new source with higher pH that causes iron or manganese precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introducing a source with organic matter that leads to more disinfection byproducts after treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engineering Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering calculations demonstrate how design decisions are supported by data and sound reasoning. These calculations allow reviewers to verify compliance with design standards.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Sizing justifications for all key components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including references to supporting data or appendices helps reviewers follow the design logic without unnecessary repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Design criteria define the standards, assumptions, and minimum requirements that guide the project. Listing these criteria ensures that both designers and reviewers understand the basis for every major decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
