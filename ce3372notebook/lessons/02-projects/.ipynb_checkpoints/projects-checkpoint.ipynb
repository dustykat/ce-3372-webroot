    "\n",
    "### Project Background:\n",
    "The City of Pecos, Texas, has identified a critical need to develop an alternate water supply in anticipation of the current wellfield reaching the end of its service life within the next 5-10 years. To ensure the city’s long-term water security, an alternate wellfield has been identified, and property rights for its development have been secured. This wellfield is located approximately 30 miles south of the city center.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a fully designed, steady-state hydraulic model of a raw-water supply system necessary to transport water from this alternate wellfield to Pecos and ensure adequate storage for future demand. This model is comprised of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A wellfield and collector network\n",
    "- A transmission pipeline\n",
    "- Intermediate and terminal storage facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Pumps, pipes, materials, and flow-control devices already selected and sized\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided model represents a hydraulically feasible system under steady-state conditions. Your task is not to redesign the infrastructure, but rather to develop, document, and demonstrate an operational control strategy that ensures reliable system performance under time-varying demand conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions and Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "The city's average daily water consumption is approximately 2.7 million gallons per day (MGD), with a peak of 3.9 million gallons per day.  The city's water plant has a capacity of 9.5 million gallons per day. The alternate wellfield is estimated to be able to produce a maximum of 3.02 MGD, with fluctuations due to seasonal variations. Transmission pipeline materials and layout should be designed considering local terrain and minimizing environmental impacts. Intermediate storage facilities may be required based on pipeline hydraulic design and system pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to apply concepts from fluid mechanics, hydraulics, and system optimization to design a pipeline that operates safely and efficiently. Your solution should address all of the technical requirements while considering cost-effectiveness and operational feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Develop a rule-based operating schedule for the wellfield and transmission system using the supplied hydraulic model.\n",
    "2. Define and justify pump and valve operating rules that respond to changing system conditions, including tank level and demand.\n",
    "3. Demonstrate that your operating rules satisfy the following operational requirements:\n",
    "  - Maintain storage tank water level within its prescribed operational band\n",
    "  - Prevent tank overflow\n",
    "  - Avoid draining the tank below minimum operating level\n",
    "  - Meet hourly system demand under normal operating conditions\n",
    "  - Describe and implement pump responses when tank levels fall too rapidly\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply your operating strategy to three supplied dynamic demand scenarios, and evaluate system performance for each case.\n",
    "5. Using model outputs, analyze system pressures and energy levels, and:\n",
    "  - Identify locations of low and high pressure in the system\n",
    "  - Produce plots of the Hydraulic Grade Line (HGL) and Energy Grade Line (EGL) for representative operating conditions\n",
    "  - Clearly describe how these plots were generated\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "EPANET does not directly generate HGL/EGL plots along the system. You are expected to develop supporting Python or Excel tools to extract model results and construct these plots.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "\n",

    "## Project 2: Storm Drainage System Design and Hydraulic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with:\n",
    "- A aerial image of an urban area in Houston, Texas\n",
    "- A scaled drawing of a storm sewer netwoek and land surface elevation data at selected locations\n",
    "- A pre-configured storm sewer network topology (nodes and links) suitable for use in SWMM (same as network in drawing above)\n",
    "- A defined drainage boundary discharging to a roadside drainage ditch\n",
    "\n",
    "The supplied network represents the physical layout of a storm sewer system but includes placeholder conduit sizes, junction elevations, and incomplete hydraulic parameters. Your task is to develop a hydraulically consistent storm drainage design using the Rational Method for initial pipe sizing and implement that design within EPA SWMM for verification and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Tasks\n",
    "1. Delineate drainage areas contributing to each inlet in the storm sewer network using the provided aerial imagery and elevation data.\n",
    "  - Construct a contour map of the study area to inform drainage direction and area boundaries\n",
    "  - Assign contributing drainage areas to inlet nodes\n",
    "  - Identify junction nodes that do not receive direct drainage input\n",
    "2. Compute inlet times and pipe travel times and apply the Rational Method to determine design flows at each inlet.\n",
    "3. Size storm sewer conduits to convey the computed design flows for a 5-year design storm applicable to Harris County, Texas.\n",
    "4. Define vertical geometry of the system by specifying:\n",
    "   - Invert (flowline) elevations at inlets and junctions\n",
    "   - Pipe offsets and soffit (crown) elevations to ensure hydraulic continuity\n",
    "5. Develop a SWMM hydraulic model of the storm sewer system, including:\n",
    "   - Assigned drainage areas and subcatchment properties\n",
    "   - Conduit sizes and slopes based on your Rational Method design\n",
    "   - Appropriate node and outlet boundary conditions\n",
    "6. Calibrate SWMM timing behavior by adjusting subcatchment (virtual) widths so that SWMM runoff response approximates Rational Method inlet timing.\n",
    "7. Apply a 3-hour, 5-year design storm to the system and evaluate hydraulic performance, with the outlet modeled as a free outfall at the ditch invert elevation.\n",
    "\n",
