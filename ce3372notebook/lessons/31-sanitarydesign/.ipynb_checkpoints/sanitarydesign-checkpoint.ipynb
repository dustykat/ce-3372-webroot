    "# Sanitary Collection Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Collection systems, or sewers, are essential for gathering wastewater and delivering it to a common destination. This can be a treatment facility for sanitary wastewater (sewage) or a direct outfall into a receiving stream for stormwater. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Collection Systems\n",
    "- Collection systems play a vital role in controlling water quality by managing potential non-point source discharges and converting them into manageable point discharges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sewer Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categories of Sewer Systems\n",
    "1. **Sanitary Sewer Systems**: Collect and transport wastewater to a treatment plant for further processing.\n",
    "2. **Storm Sewer Systems**: Collect and direct stormwater to a receiving water body, addressing nuisance flooding and improving infrastructure serviceability.\n",
    "3. **Combined Sewer Systems (CSS)**: Designed to handle both sanitary and stormwater. These are no longer built in the USA, but older cities maintain legacy systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Features Across Sewer Types\n",
    "- Hydraulics: Open channel flow.\n",
    "- Components: Pipes, boxes, junctions, and lift stations.\n",
    "- Purpose: Sanitary systems protect public health by isolating waste, while storm systems manage nuisance flooding and may also confer water quality benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sanitary Sewer Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "- Underground pipelines collect and transmit sewage from distributed sources to a central location.\n",
    "- Operate as open channels driven by gravity.\n",
    "- Require lift stations to maintain flow in certain areas, with the pumped flow conveyed through force mains before returning to open flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Governing Regulations\n",
    "- Federal, state, and municipal laws dictate materials, joints, labeling, and more.\n",
    "- Designs often require the involvement of a licensed professional engineer (PE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hydraulic Behavior\n",
    "- Sewage behaves like water but may contain up to 5% solids by mass.\n",
    "- Design concerns include corrosion and safety for maintenance personnel.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Estimation Methods\n",
    "- Small residential areas: Based on population or equivalent residential units (ERU).\n",
    "- Larger areas: Derived from land use, anticipated population, and measured flows in similar nearby systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow Calculation Requirements\n",
    "1. Include average dry weather flow, peaking factors, and inflow/infiltration.\n",
    "2. Account for immediate post-construction and end-of-life (50 years) conditions.\n",
