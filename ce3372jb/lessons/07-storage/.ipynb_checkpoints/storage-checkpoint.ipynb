    "Storage plays a critical role in drinking water supply and treatment systems, serving as a buffer between water production and consumption. Water storage facilities, such as reservoirs, tanks, and towers, are designed to hold treated water before distribution, ensuring a reliable and consistent supply to meet varying demand throughout a day. Storage capacity allows for managing peak demand periods, fire protection, system maintenance, and emergency situations like power outages or supply disruptions. It also helps maintain adequate water pressure across the distribution network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of water treatment, storage can be part of both raw water (before treatment) and treated water (after treatment) systems. Raw water storage allows for managing fluctuations in water sources, such as rivers or groundwater, ensuring a stable supply for treatment plants. On the treated water side, storage ensures that water has time for disinfectants, such as chlorine, to inactivate harmful pathogens effectively, providing an additional safeguard for public health. The strategic placement and design of storage systems are critical in maintaining water quality and ensuring a continuous, safe supply to the community."
