Quiz: Effects of Urban Development on Floods
Question 1

What hydrologic change commonly occurs in urban areas compared to rural areas?
A. Increased infiltration and reduced surface runoff
B. Decreased flood frequency and peak discharge
C. Increased surface runoff and reduced infiltration
D. Reduced frequency of high-flow events

Answer:
C. Increased surface runoff and reduced infiltration
Question 2

Which factor primarily contributes to higher flood peaks in urban areas?
A. Increased vegetation coverage
B. Enhanced groundwater recharge
C. Impermeable surfaces and drainage networks
D. Greater soil moisture storage

Answer:
C. Impermeable surfaces and drainage networks
Question 3

How do urban drainage systems influence runoff?
A. They increase overland flow distances, delaying peak discharge.
B. They reduce runoff by storing water in vegetated areas.
C. They decrease the travel time of runoff to streams.
D. They redirect runoff into groundwater recharge zones.

Answer:
C. They decrease the travel time of runoff to streams.
Question 4

What is a key hydraulic effect of stream channel modifications in urban areas?
A. Increased channel storage capacity during floods
B. Reduced sediment transport rates
C. Backwater effects due to channel constrictions
D. Greater aquifer recharge rates

Answer:
C. Backwater effects due to channel constrictions
Question 5

Why do small floods increase more dramatically than large floods in urbanized areas?
A. Soil saturation reduces runoff during large storms.
B. Smaller floods are less affected by urban drainage changes.
C. Urban surfaces amplify small storm responses.
D. Channel modifications target large flood reduction only.

Answer:
C. Urban surfaces amplify small storm responses.
Question 6

Which urban development feature can exacerbate streambank erosion?
A. Vegetated riparian zones
B. Undersized culverts
C. Rainwater harvesting systems
D. Permeable pavements

Answer:
B. Undersized culverts
Question 7

What was the primary impact of urbanization observed in Mercer Creek, Washington?
A. Reduced annual maximum discharge
B. Delayed peak discharge times during storms
C. Increased flood volume and peak discharge
D. Stabilized discharge rates over time

Answer:
C. Increased flood volume and peak discharge
Question 8

Which method can help reduce urban flood hazards?
A. Replacing vegetation with impermeable surfaces
B. Constructing larger stormwater conveyance channels
C. Constricting floodplains to concentrate flow
D. Eliminating all riparian vegetation

Answer:
B. Constructing larger stormwater conveyance channels
Question 9

Why are real-time streamflow gaging stations valuable in urban areas?
A. They enhance sediment transport during floods.
B. They provide data for immediate flood management decisions.
C. They eliminate the need for rainfall records.
D. They prevent stormwater runoff entirely.

Answer:
B. They provide data for immediate flood management decisions.
Question 10

What is a key conclusion about the effects of urbanization on floods?
A. Urbanization generally reduces flood risks.
B. Urbanization primarily impacts small streams in large basins.
C. Urbanization increases the size and frequency of floods.
D. Urbanization has no measurable impact on flood characteristics.

Answer:
C. Urbanization increases the size and frequency of floods.
