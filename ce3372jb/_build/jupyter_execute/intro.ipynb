    ">***How to Use***\n",
    ">1. Clone the entire repository to /var/www/html/ce-3372-webroot.  Have your main index link to this directory i.e. `http://your-fqdn-server.org/ce-3372-webroot/` You can see working example at [http:/54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/](http:/54.243.252.9/engr-1330-webroot/)\n",
    ">2. If you plan to modify things, many of the internal links use IP/hostname == `54.243.252.9`, so you will have to change these addresses to your server.  The string editor `sed` will become your friend!\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `3-Readings` directory contains excerpts of copyrighted materials and should be exposed with care on a web server; generally because no one reads anymore, its probably safe enough to protect using an `.htaccess` approach. In my courses one accesses things through the syllabus links, and the syllabus itself is best accessed through our LMS (Blackboard). \n",
