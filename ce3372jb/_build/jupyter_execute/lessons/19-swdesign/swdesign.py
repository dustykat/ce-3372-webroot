# # 19. Storm Water Design 

# ## General Concepts
# 
# 1. Introduction to Stormwater Management
# 
#   - Importance of managing stormwater in urban and rural settings
#   - Objectives of stormwater design (flood control, water quality improvement)
#   - Regulatory frameworks and standards (EPA regulations, local guidelines)
# 
# 2. Hydrologic Considerations
# 
#   - Hydrologic Cycle and stormwater generation
#   - Runoff Estimation Methods:
#         Rational Method (Q = CiA)
#         SCS Curve Number Method
#         Time of Concentration
#   - Design Storms: return periods and intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves
# 
# 3. Hydraulic Design of Stormwater Systems
# 
#   - Stormwater Collection Systems:
#         Gutters, inlets, and storm drains
#         Conduit sizing (pipe flow, Manningâ€™s Equation)
#         Energy and hydraulic grade lines
#   - Detention and Retention Basins:
#         Purpose (peak flow reduction, groundwater recharge)
#         Volume calculation and outlet structure design
# 
# 4. Green Infrastructure & Low Impact Development (LID)
# 
#   - Permeable pavements, bioswales, rain gardens, and green roofs
#   - Benefits: reducing runoff, enhancing water quality, sustainability
#   - Integration of LID with traditional infrastructure
# 
# - Stormwater Quality Considerations
# 
#   - Pollutant transport in stormwater (sediments, nutrients, oils)
#   - Best Management Practices (BMPs) for water quality improvement
#   - Wet ponds, vegetative filters, and constructed wetlands
# 
# - Software and Tools in Stormwater Design
# 
#   - Overview of modeling tools (EPA-SWMM, HEC-HMS)
#   - Introduction to geographic information systems (GIS) for stormwater management
# 
# - Case Studies and Practical Applications
# 
#   - Real-world examples of stormwater design projects
#   - Challenges and innovations in stormwater management
# 
# - Emerging technologies (smart stormwater systems, climate-resilient infrastructure)
