    "## Introduction\n",
    "Inflow and infiltration (I&I) are critical concepts in the design and operation of sanitary sewer systems. These phenomena increase the volume of wastewater needing treatment, leading to higher operational costs and potential system overflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "1. **Inflow**: Direct connections to sanitary sewers that allow water to enter the system, including:\n",
    "   - Roof gutters\n",
    "   - French drains\n",
    "   - Unauthorized stormwater connections\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Infiltration**: Leakage into sanitary sewers through:\n",
    "   - Cracks in pipes\n",
    "   - High water tables\n",
    "   - Defective joints and junction boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Inflow and Infiltration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizing I&I\n",
    "- **Inflow** is often represented in red.\n",
    "- **Infiltration** is represented in blue.\n",

    "## Impacts of I&I\n",

    "### Operational Challenges\n",
    "- Increases in treatment plant loads during wet weather.\n",
    "- Overflows in sanitary systems.\n",
    "- Additional wear and tear on infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigation Measures\n",
    "1. Regular inspection and maintenance of sewer systems.\n",
    "2. Prohibition and removal of unauthorized stormwater connections.\n",
    "3. Lining or replacing deteriorated pipes to reduce infiltration.\n",
