# # Pipeline Head Loss 

# Water moves from higher to lower energy
# 
# - Path of least resistance
# - Head is energy per unit weight of a fluid 
# - Pumps are used to add energy to move water to a higher elevation or over a barrier 
# 
# - Gravity flow: Change in elevation provides the required energy 
# - Pressure flow: Change in pressure provides the required energy 
# 
# Flowing water encounters friction/resistance; hence there is loss of energy along a flow path. 
# The mean section velocity is related to cross sectional flow area and volumetric discharge as:
# 
# $$ \bar{V} = \frac{Q}{A} $$

# ---
# 
# ## Continunity at Different Sections
# 
# The continunity (conservation of mass) across two cross-sections of pipe as shown 
# 
# ![](continunity-section.png)
# 
# is $A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$. It is a statement that discharge is the same in each portion of pipe unless there is a loss somewhere.

# ## Continunity at Junctions
# 
# A junction is a location where two or more conduits join together.  By convention (collective agreement) flow into a junction is a positive value, flow out from a junction is a negative value. External demands are conceptualized as flow **out** of the junction. While uncommon,flow injected into a junction it would be treated as a negative demand (in most computation tools!)
# 
# ![](continunity-junction.png) 
# 
# The continunity equation for the junction depicted above is $Q_1 - Q_2 - Q_3 - D = 0$ An easy way to remember continunity is $In - Out = 0$

# ---
# 
# ## Energy Equation
# 
# The energy equation (modified bernoulli equation) relates the total dynamic head at two points in a system, accounting for frictional losses and any added head from a pump.
# 
# ![](nrg-eqn.png)
# 
# - $h_L$ = head losses (pipe loss + fitting losses)
# - $h_p$ = added pump head
# - $h_t$ = head loss to a turbine
# 

# The parts of the equation are illustrated below
# 
# ![](nrg-picture.png)
# 
# The left-most group is the total energy in the lower reservoir. 
# The pump head provides the energy to lift from the suction side of the pump to the upper reservoir.  The water is physically moving upward in the suction pipe, while hydraulically flowing downhill to some minimum at the pump. After the pump supplies additional momentum the water has increased energy to continue its uphill trek to the upper reservoir.  The first group to the right of the equal sign is the total energy in the upper reservoir.  The last group is the total head loss in the system.
# 
# Observe that the HGL and EGL in the system slope downward in the direction of flow; further observe that nearly all groups are dependent on the discharge rate; added head required changes with $Q$ as does the head loss.
# 
# ---
# 
# The hydraulic grade line (HGL) is depicted below as is the energy grade line (EGL)
# ![](hgl.png)

# 
# We can combine continunity and energy to explain/predic common hydraulic behavior

# ### Example: Time to Drain a Storage Tank
# 
# Imagine an ordinary bucket (diameter = 1 foot) with a Â½-inch hole drilled at the base of the bucket.
# 
# #### Problem Statement
# Develop an equation that estimates time-to-drain for different fill depths (with an unknown drainage coefficient).  Use measured data to infer the drainage coefficient.
# 
# ![](time2drain.png)
# 
# #### Sketch Situation; List Known Values
# 
# ![](time2drain-sketch.png)
# 
# The known values in this case are the tank area $A$ from its given diameter, the outlet area $a$ from its given diameter, and the starting depth $H$.
# 
# #### List Unknown Values
# 
# In this case the time to drain and the numerical value of a drainage coefficient that relates the constriction of the jet at the outlet.  We can keep it as an unknown variable and use the observations to find a numerical value for this particular bucket.
# 
# #### Governing Principles
# 
# - Conservation of mass (Continunity)
# - Conservation of energy (Energy equation)
# 
# #### Solution
# 
# First use continunity:
# 
# ![](ttd-continunity.png)
# 
# Then use energy:
# 
# ![](ttd-nrg.png)
# 
# Now apply analysis (that Calculus stuff!)
# 
# ![](ttd-calculus-1.png)
# 
# Continue to tidy up the equation
# 
# ![](ttd-calculus-2.png)
# 
# Now we can construct a tool using Computational Thinking (ENGR-1330) methods

# In[1]:


def HofT(time,Cd,Ho,D,d,g): #create our depth vs time function
    import math
    A = 0.25*math.pi*D**2
    a = 0.25*math.pi*d**2
    K = math.sqrt(2*g)*(a/A)
    HofT = (math.sqrt(Ho)-time*Cd*K/2)**2 # if inner part is <0, then will throw an error
    return(HofT)


# In[2]:


# now a quick test
Ho = 1.0 # one foot depth
D  = 1.0 # one foot diameter
d  = 0.042 # 1/2 inch diameter (in feet)
g  = 32.2 # grabity in US unitz
Cd = 1
time = 139
print("Depth Remain at ",time," seconds is ",round(HofT(time,Cd,Ho,D,d,g),3)," feet")


# Now put the function into a repetition structure and use trial-and-error to find a good value for Cd.  The goal is for remaining depth to be zero for all cases.

# In[3]:


D  = 1.0 # one foot diameter
d  = 0.042 # 1/2 inch diameter (in feet)
g  = 32.2 # grabity in US unitz
Cd = 1.125    # Use 2, 1.5, 1.25, 1.125 will see values go up then down towards zero
Ho = [1.00,0.75,0.53,0.29,0.00] # table of observed depths
time = [127.85,106.41,84.71,57.94,0.00] # table of observed times
how_many = len(Ho)
print("For Cd = ", Cd)
for i in range(how_many):
    print("Depth Remain at ",time[i]," seconds is ",round(HofT(time[i],Cd,Ho[i],D,d,g),3)," feet")


# The example illustrates the combination of analysis and computation to find a discharge coefficient for a cylindrical tank.  These kind of problems are especially fun when the tank geometry is weird and we normally use:
# - Storage-Elevation or Depth-Area tables.
# - Finite-difference type computations (rather than analytical functions)

# ## Head Loss Models (for losses in closed conduits)
# 
# ### Darcy-Weisbach
# 
# The Darcy-Weisbach frictional head-loss model for pipe flow is 
# 
# $$h_f = f \frac{L}{D}\frac{V^2}{2g}$$
# 
# Frictional loss proportional to: 
# - Length
# - Velocity$^2$ 
# 
# Inversely proportional to: 
# - Cross sectional area 
# 
# Loss coefficient ($f$) depends on 
# - Reynolds number (fluid and flow properties) 
# - Roughness height (pipe material properties) 
# 
# #### Reynolds' ($Re_d$) Number
# 
# $$Re_d = \frac{\rho V D}{\mu} = \frac{V D}{\nu}$$
# 
# 
# Find viscosity as function of temperature from table look-up at [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesUS/WaterPropertiesUS.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesUS/WaterPropertiesUS.html) or [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesSI/WaterPropertiesSI.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesSI/WaterPropertiesSI.html) or other source.
# 
# #### Darcy-Weisbach "$f$" Factor
# 
# The friction factor is determined from a Moody Chart or Colebrook-White or Jain equation like:
# 
# $$f = \frac{0.25}{[log10(\frac{k_s}{3.7D}+\frac{5.74}{Re^{0.9}})]^2}$$
# 
# A web-application with a roughness height database is [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/Databases/RoughnessHeight/RoughnessHeight.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/Databases/RoughnessHeight/RoughnessHeight.html)
# 
# A web-application to compute friction factor given $Re$ and material properties ($k_s$) is [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/pipehydraulics/FrictionFactor/FrictionFactor.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/pipehydraulics/FrictionFactor/FrictionFactor.html)
# 
# #### Using the D-W model
# 
# To compute headloss is straightforward, first organize your data:
# 
# 1. Material type, lookup roughness height at [http://54.243.252.9/cgi-bin/Databases/RoughnessHeight/RoughnessHeight.py](http://54.243.252.9/cgi-bin/Databases/RoughnessHeight/RoughnessHeight.py) or another source.  Remember to cite the source.
# 2. Viscosity at desired operating temperature, lookup at [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesUS/WaterPropertiesUS.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesUS/WaterPropertiesUS.html) or [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesSI/WaterPropertiesSI.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/WaterPropertiesSI/WaterPropertiesSI.html) or another source.  Remember to cite the source.
# 3. Use the pipe diameter and desired flowrate to compute a mean section velocity.
# 4. Compute the Reynolds number; use the equation or [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/ReynoldsNumber/ReynoldsNumber.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/fluidmechanics/ReynoldsNumber/ReynoldsNumber.html)
# 5. Compute the friction factor; use the Moody Chart or Jain equation or [http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/pipehydraulics/FrictionFactor/FrictionFactor.html](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/pipehydraulics/FrictionFactor/FrictionFactor.html)
# 6. Finally compute the head loss as $h_f = f \frac{L}{D}\frac{V^2}{2g}$

# ### Hazen-Williams
# 
# The Hazen-Williams head loss model is for water only, while a bit contrived it is used in the USA extensively.
# 
# ![](HW-formula.png)
# 
# The model expresses frictional loss 
# 
# - proportional to Length
# - proportional to Velocity^(1.8)
# - Inversely proportional to cross section area (as hydraulic radius)
# 
# The Loss coefficient ($C_h$) depends on
# - Pipe material, finish, and age
# 
# The model should be restricted to:
# 
# - Turbulent flow only (Re>4000)
# - WATER ONLY!
# 
# The discharge form for a circular conduit (aka pipe) is
# 
# ![](HWQ-formula.png)
# 
# The leading constant changes for US Customary and SI Units.
# 
# #### Hazen-Williams "C" Factor
# 
# These are generally tabulated and you can look up values on the internet.
# 
# ![](CH-table.png)
# 
# #### Hydraulic Radius
# 
# HW is often presented as a velocity equation using the hydraulic radius
# 
# ![](HW-RH-formula.png)
# 
# The hydraulic radius is the ratio of cross section flow area to wetted perimeter
# 
# ![](RH-formula.png)
# 
# A full circular pipe has a hydraulic radius equal to 1/4 of the pipe inside diameter
# 
# ![](RH-Geometry.png)

# ### Chezy-Mannings
# 
# The Chezy-Mannings head loss model, while common in open channel flow and culverts, is not often used on pressure-pipe systems, but it is sometimes applied in large diameter pipes and tunnels (siphons).
# 
# ![](CM-formula.png)
# 
# Frictional loss proportional to
# 
# - Length, Velocity^2
# - Inversely proportional to
# - Cross section area (as hydraulic radius)
# 
# Loss coefficient depends on
# 
# - Material, finish
# 
# The constant in the denominator changes for US Customary and SI Units.
# 
# #### Mannings "n" 
# 
# These are generally tabulated; for example:

# ### Fitting (Minor) Losses
# 
# Fittings, joints, elbows, inlets, outlets cause additional head
# loss. Called âminorâ loss not because of magnitude, but because
# they occur over short distances.
#

# ## Computing Discharge from Specified Head Loss
# 
# ### Computational Thinking/Data Science Approach (ENGR 1330)
# 
# CT/DS Approach
# 
# * State the programming problem
# * Known (Inputs)
# * Unknown (Outputs)
# * Governing Equation(s)
# * Test the tool
# 
# #### State the programming problem
# 
# Build a tool that takes inputs for the Jain equation and produces an estimate of discharge
# 
# Build an interface (notebook) that accepts the inputs, calls the function, and returns the computed discharge
# 
# #### Known (Inputs)
# Engineer will specify: 
# 
# * Diameter, D; 
# * Length of pipe, L; 
# * Roughness height, e; 
# * Viscosity, $\nu$; 
# * Gravitational acceleration constant, g;
# * Head loss
# 
# #### Unknown (Outputs)
# The tool will compute and report Discharge, Q.
# 
# #### Governing Equation(s)
# A compact form of the equation to be evaluated is
# 
# $
# Q=-0.965 D^2 \sqrt{\frac{gDh_f}{L}}ln( \frac{k_s}{3.7D}+\frac{1.78\nu}{D\sqrt{\frac{gDh_f}{L}}} )
