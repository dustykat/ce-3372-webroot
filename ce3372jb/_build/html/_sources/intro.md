# CE 3372 Water Systems Design

This is the electronic instructor's notes for Dr. Cleveland's section(s) of CE 3372 at Texas Tech University.

These instructor's notes are intended to **parallel** the regular textbook: [https://www.amazon.com/Hydrology-Hydraulic-Systems-Ram-Gupta/dp/1577664558](https://www.amazon.com/Hydrology-Hydraulic-Systems-Ram-Gupta/dp/1577664558)

The course content is entirely deployed on a web server hosted at Amazon Web Services at [http://54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/](http://54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/)  This book is located on the same server at [http://54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/ce3372-jb/ce3372jb/\_build/html](http://54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/ce3372-jb/ce3372jb/_build/html)

**GitHub Repository**
This entire course (book, and exercises) is contained in a public repository on GitHub [https://github.com/dustykat/ce-3372-webroot](https://github.com/dustykat/ce-3372-webroot)

>***How to Use***
>1. Clone the entire repository to /var/www/html/ce-3372-webroot.  Have your main index link to this directory i.e. `http://your-fqdn-server.org/ce-3372-webroot/` You can see working example at [http:/54.243.252.9/ce-3372-webroot/](http:/54.243.252.9/engr-1330-webroot/)
>2. If you plan to modify things, many of the internal links use IP/hostname == `54.243.252.9`, so you will have to change these addresses to your server.  The string editor `sed` will become your friend!

- The `3-Readings` directory contains excerpts of copyrighted materials and should be exposed with care on a web server; generally because no one reads anymore, its probably safe enough to protect using an `.htaccess` approach. In my courses one accesses things through the syllabus links, and the syllabus itself is best accessed through our LMS (Blackboard).
