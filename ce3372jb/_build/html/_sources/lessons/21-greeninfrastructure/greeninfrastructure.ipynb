    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Section 502 of the Clean Water Act defines green infrastructure as \"...the\n",
    "range of measures that use plant or soil systems, permeable pavement or other\n",
    "permeable surfaces or substrates, stormwater harvest and reuse, or landscaping to store,\n",
    "infiltrate, or evapotranspirate stormwater and reduce flows to sewer systems or to surface\n",
    "waters.”\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} Simple GI Definition\n",
    "Green infrastructure involves practices that utilize vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage stormwater and create livable urban spaces.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Conventional stormwater infrastructure, piped drainage and water treatment systems, are designed to move urban stormwater away from the built environment in contrast to green infrastructure (GI) that reduces and treats stormwater at its source while delivering environmental, social, and economic benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals include:\n",
    "- Mitigate urban flooding.\n",
    "- Reduce pollutant loads in runoff.\n",
    "- Enhance groundwater recharge.\n",
    "- Provide ecological and social co-benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison with Gray Infrastructure:\n",
    "- Gray infrastructure relies on engineered systems like pipes and detention basins.\n",
    "- Green infrastructure emphasizes decentralized systems and natural hydrology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Benefits:\n",
    "- Environmental: Water quality improvement, habitat creation.\n",
    "- Economic: Reduced infrastructure costs, increased property values.\n",
    "- Social: Enhanced urban aesthetics, public health improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy and Regulatory Framework:\n",
    "- Clean Water Act Section 319 (Nonpoint Source Pollution).\n",
    "- Clean Water Act Section 502 (GI Specific).\n",
    "- Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permits.\n",
