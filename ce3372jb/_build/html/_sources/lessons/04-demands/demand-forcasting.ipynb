    "The curve above is identical in structure to resource capacity limited growth that you learned in Environmental Engineering (CE 3309).  Examples that will follow such a curve are yeast cells in a sugar rich environment. Dextrose (glucose) is a simple sugar and is the primary energy source for yeast. It is readily taken up by yeast cells and metabolized through glycolysis, followed by either fermentation (anaerobic conditions) or respiration (aerobic conditions).  In aerobic conditions the yeast cells will multiply until nearly all the dextrose is used, then the growth rate declines dramatically.  The asymptote is determined to some extent by the amount of sugar originally present.\n",

    "## Longer-Term Forecasting\n",
    "Longer-term population forecasting is a critical aspect of urban and regional planning. It helps in predicting future water demand and ensuring sustainable resource management. This approach uses historical census data and more complex techniques to estimate population growth over decades.\n",

    "### Comparison Forecasting: \n",
    "Projects growth by comparing with geographically similar areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ratio Method (Transposition)**:\n",
    "   - Ratio: $ P_t = P_0 \\cdot \\frac{P'_t}{P'_0} $\n",
    "   - Where:\n",
    "     - $ P_t $: Future population of the target area\n",
    "     - $ P_0 $: Current population of the target area\n",
    "     - $ P'_t $: Future population of the reference area\n",
    "     - $ P'_0 $: Current population of the reference area\n",
    "   - Example: If a nearby city with similar characteristics has shown consistent growth, its population ratios can help estimate the target area's growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation Method**:\n",
    "   - Uses statistical techniques, such as ordinary least squares (OLS), to fit a predictive equation.\n",
    "   - Formula:\n",
    "   - Correlation: $ P_t = a \\cdot P'_t + b $\n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - $ P_t $: Target area's population\n",
    "     - $ P'_t $: Reference area's population\n",

    "### Component Techniques\n",
    "Component-based forecasting divides population dynamics into smaller measurable parts to understand the influences of births, deaths, and migration.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Birth rate (B) and death rate (D) determine the natural increase or decrease in population.\n",

    "     $ P_t = P_0 + (B - D) \\cdot \\Delta t $\n",

    "     - $ \\Delta t $: Time interval in years\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Composite Models**:\n",
    "   - Combine multiple demographic factors (e.g., age distribution, economic conditions).\n",
    "   - These models require significant data and computational resources but provide more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Longer-Term Forecasting\n",
    "- Provides a detailed understanding of population trends.\n",
    "- Helps design infrastructure that meets future needs.\n",
    "- Incorporates economic and social factors for robust predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Long-term forcasting using population dynamics models is a specalist sport.  In the 1980's the solutions to the dynamic systems were by means of Routh Arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Routh Array is a mathematical tool used in control theory and differential equations to determine the stability of a system by analyzing the characteristic equation of a linear system. In the context of population dynamics models, it can be adapted to assess the stability of equilibrium points in systems governed by differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application in Population Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Population dynamics models often involve differential equations describing the growth or decline of a population. Stability analysis determines whether the population will converge to an equilibrium (e.g., carrying capacity) or diverge (e.g., unbounded growth or extinction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Routh Array helps in this analysis by examining the characteristic equation derived from the linearized system of differential equations around an equilibrium point. The characteristic equation typically takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(s)=a_ns^n+a_{n‚àí1}s^{n‚àí1}+\\dots+a_0=0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s$ represents the eigenvalues, and $a_i$ are coefficients related to the model's parameters.  (You did similar work with Lagrangian polynomials in Engineering Mathematics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps in Using the Routh Array:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct the Characteristic Polynomial: Derive it from the population model's linearized system.\n",
    "2. Build the Routh Array:\n",
    "        Organize the coefficients of the polynomial into a tabular form.\n",
    "        Populate the rows of the array using a recursive formula derived from the coefficients.\n",
    "3. Determine Stability:\n",
    "   - Check the signs of the first column of the array.\n",
    "   - If all entries in the first column are positive, the system is stable (all roots have negative real parts).\n",
    "   - Any sign change indicates potential instability (roots with positive real parts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficient Stability Check: The Routh Array provides stability information without explicitly solving for eigenvalues.\n",
    "- Insightful for Complex Models: Useful for models with higher-order dynamics where solving characteristic equations is challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Population Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a population model with logistic growth and additional dynamics, leading to a characteristic equation like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s^3+3s^2+3s+1=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Routh Array, we can determine whether small perturbations around the equilibrium will return to stability or diverge.\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applicable only to linearized models (near equilibrium points).\n",
    "- Requires the system's differential equations to be representable in polynomial form.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method provides a systematic way to analyze stability, making it a valuable tool in theoretical studies of population dynamics and their control mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today (2023) we would simply build a numerical model of the dynamic system, and perturb the model and see how it responds.  In the 1980's computers were not readily available, so mathematicians invented these clever techniques.\n",
