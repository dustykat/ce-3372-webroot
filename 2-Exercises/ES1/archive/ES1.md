# ES-1

## Purpose:
Demonstrate ability to read and summarize relevant engineering literature, and communicate that summary in writing.

## Exercise:

Read the linked article from a 2013 issue of “Civil Engineering.” [https://3.137.111.182/ce-3372-webbook/exercise1/LosAngelesAquaductHistory.pdf](https://3.137.111.182/ce-3372-webbook/exercise1/LosAngelesAquaductHistory.pdf)

## Deliverables

A brief (2 pages maximum, exclusive of references) summary of the article. In the summary:

- Describe the Los Angeles Aqueduct. 
- List the different types of conveyances and hydraulic machines that are employed (closed conduit, open conduit, lift stations, etc.) in its operation. 
- Explain what design and/or construction features were employed that were novel for their time. 
- Conclude with a comparison of the Los Angeles Aqueduct to a large-diameter gas pipeline. What are the similarities and differences?
- Cite any external references you employed for the exercise (these citations are not included in the page count).
