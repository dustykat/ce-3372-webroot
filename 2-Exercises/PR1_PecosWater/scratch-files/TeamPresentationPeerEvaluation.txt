Here’s a suggested structure for your 5-question ranking form to evaluate engineering students' presentations:

    Clarity and Organization
        Was the presentation well-structured, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion?

    Content Quality
        Did the presentation demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic, with accurate and relevant information?

    Visual and Verbal Communication
        Were slides or visual aids engaging and easy to understand? Did the speaker communicate ideas clearly and confidently?

    Engagement and Delivery
        Did the presenter maintain audience interest, use appropriate tone and pace, and respond effectively to questions?

    Professionalism and Teamwork (if applicable)
        Did the presenter display professionalism in behavior, attire, and preparation? For team presentations, did all members contribute effectively?
