    "The Water Distribution Systems Aanalysis (WDSA) conference focuses on the latest challenges, innovations, and methodologies regarding water distribution systems. It was first organized as a conference track at the Annual Conference of the Water Resources Planning and Management Division of ASCE. Since 2006, it has been held every year as part of the EWRI World Water Congress or a stand-alone conference.\n",

    "One component of WDSA conferences is a contest called the *Battle of Water Networks*; where competitors employ modeling to solve a challenge problem. Usually the computation engine is an unaltered EPANET model.
