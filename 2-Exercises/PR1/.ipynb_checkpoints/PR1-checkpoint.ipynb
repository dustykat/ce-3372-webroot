    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "A small residential subdivision (SomewhereUSA) is depicted in the figure below; plotted on the figure is a layout of a water distribution system for the  subdivision. The blue line segments are pipes (ductile iron) and are labeled (P1, P2, . . . ). The blue circles are nodes and are labeled (N1, N2, . . . ). The yellow polygons represent the demand lots assigned to each node. For example, node N2 supplies the six (6) individual lots located near the node.\n",

    "- An engineering preliminary design report for the proposed water distribution network.\n",

    "1.  The required burial depths required for the water distribution pipes.\n",

    "1.  A node-pipe layout map/drawing, overlain on the subdivision map.   \n",
    "    - The pipe layout can be a skeleton system (you do not need to show every meter -- demands should be grouped from 6-8 houses/node).\n",

    "1.  A hydraulic simulation under normal flow (no fire) conditions.  \n",
    "    - The model must be interpreted and the minimum and maximum pressures identified (along with their locations).  If special items are required (pressure-reducing-valves; booster pumps; $\\dots$) these must be described and their need explained.\n",

    "1. Identification of disinfection residual minimum location in the network under normal conditions.\n",
