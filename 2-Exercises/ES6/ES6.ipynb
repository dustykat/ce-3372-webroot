    "Demonstrate flow-equalization volume required for a storage tank to leverage some constant flow rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze daily water cumulative demand (from time varying outflows)\n",
    "- Find equivalent constant draw rate\n",
    "- Use double mass curve concept to find maximum deviations to size an equalization tank."
