    "Figure 1 is an older (circa 1993) aerial image of a portion of Houston, Texas. The red polygon is the drainage boundary for a storm sewer system that drains North from the part of the area near Westheimer Road to a tributary of Buffalo Bayou and East from the area. The\n",
    "drainage ditch is shown as the “blue” fuzzy line on the figure. Drainage in the ditch is from\n",
    "West to East. The two main streets in the study area are highlighted in magenta.  \n",

    "The bottom of the pond is at elevation 139 feet. \n",
    "Several rectangular contour lines are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pond has one foot of water in storage, the blue line represents the pool elevation, and the volume would be the product of the area enclosed by the blue contour and the depth (1 foot).\n",
    "At depths greater than one foot, the pond sides are sloped and not vertical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inlet is a 1-foot diameter culvert that drains a 9-acre light-industrial complex.\n",
    "The invert elevation of this culvert at the pond is 139 feet.\n",
    "The outlet works is a riser pipe which activates when the stage in the pond is 141 feet.\n",
    "The diameter of the outlet pipe is 8-inches.\n",
    "A secondary outlet pipe, also 8-inches activates at elevation 145 feet.\n",
    "A small 4-inch drain pipe is at the pond bottom so that the pond drains completely after a storm.\n",
    "If the pond stage exceeds 146 feet, the emergency overflow is a rectangular swale 25 feet wide and 2 feet deep which drains directly into a nearby bayou.\n"
