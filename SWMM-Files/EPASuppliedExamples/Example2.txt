Example2
========

This example reproduces Example 1 of the 1988 Extran Users
Manual. It is a simple, two branch pipe network with a free
outfall subject to inflows at three locations. These inflows
cause several pipes to surcharge and several nodes to flood.
Also included with this example is a data file containing the
flow results for two of the pipes using SWMM 3. We will compare
these with the results from SWMM 5.

1. After opening the model, run it. From the Status Report note
   which nodes flood and which links are surcharged.

2. Register the SWMM 3 results file with the project by selecting
   Project | Calibration Data and entering EXTRAN1.DAT in the
   LINK FLOW data field.

3. Create a time series plot for flow in Link 1602. Note how the
   "observed" data from the SWMM 3 results are plotted along with
   those of SWMM 5. Do the same for Link 1030.

4. To relieve the flooding, add an orifice regulator between
   Nodes 82309 and 15009 with the following properties:
   Type:          Bottom
   Shape:         Circular
   Height:        2 ft
   Width:         2 ft
   Crest Ht.      0 ft
   Disch. Coeff.: 0.85
   This re-creates the data for Example 3 of the Extran Manual.
   Run the model and check the Status Report to see if this
   eliminates the flooding.
