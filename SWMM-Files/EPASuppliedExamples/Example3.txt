Example3
========

This example illustrates SWMM 5's Rule-based Control feature
for simulating real-time control. The data file applies to a
real-world combined sewer system with a diversion pump installed
to help prevent local overflows. The scenario modelled contains
only dry weather flow, and illustrates the use of DWF time-of-
day patterns to have DWF vary diurnally. We suggest trying the
following:

(The layout of this sewer network will only allow Dynamic Wave
 flow routing to be used.)

1. After opening the file, note how the pump station is modelled
   with a storage node and a Type4 pump. Bring up the Controls
   Editor to view the rules that control the on/off status of the
   pump.

2. Also view the hourly DWF time patterns that are assigned to
   each node that receives DWF. The base-line DWF was set to 1.0
   for these nodes, so the pattern multipliers are the actual flows
   in this example.

3. Run the model (for a 24-hour simulation).

4. Create one time series plot of water depth at the storage node
   and another for flow in the pump. With both plots visible,
   select Window | Tile so that they can both be viewed without
   any overlap. See if the plots reflect the desired control rules.

5. Create a scatter plot of pump flow versus water depth in the
   storage node and note how this plot is faithful to the control
   rules and to the pump's operating curve.
