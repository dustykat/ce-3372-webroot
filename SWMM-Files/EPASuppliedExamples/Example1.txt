Example1
========

This example models runoff quantity and quality in a small
hypothetical drainage area. It consists of 8 subcatchments
connected to a system of 1 to 2 foot diameter storm drains.
There are two pollutants (TSS and lead) and two land uses
(residential and undeveloped). Rainfall data for both a
short-term 36-hour period and a long-term 2 year period are
provided.

Here are some suggestions for running this example:

1. The model is set up to run in single event mode for a period
   of 36 hours using Kinematic Wave routing. Run the simulation.

2. View the Status Report for the run, noting the Continuity error.

3. Select some different output variables (e.g. subcatchment runoff,
   node flooding, link flow) for viewing on the study area map. Use
   the Day/Time controls on the Map Browser to move back and forth
   through time.

4. Try animating the map by using the Animator Toolbar (make the
   toolbar visible by selecting View | Toolbars | Animator from the
   Main Menu).

5. Try generating some other types of reports, such as a time series
   plot and a profile plot.

6. Change the Simulation Options to use Dynamic Wave routing and
   re-run the analysis. 

7. Modify the model to run a continuous simulation as follows:
   a. Edit the rain gage and change its Data Source to File, click
      on the File Name field and specify the rain data file named 
      sta310301.dat, and enter 310301 for the Station Number.
   b. Edit the Simulation Options as follows:
      i. change the Routing Method back to Kinematic Wave
      ii. make the End Date 01-02-2000 (for a 2-year simulation)
      iii. change the Routing Time Step to 5 minutes.

8. Run the simulation (it may take several minutes). Try generating
   a Statistics Report to see how the magnitude of various kinds of
   events (rainfall, runoff, quality, etc.) are distributed over
   time.
