    "Build an EPANET model, using the Hazen-Williams head loss model of the network. From your preparation, or the completed model:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)  Write the node equations of continuity for Nodes 1-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)  Write the head loss equations for each of the pipes in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)  Make a screen capture of the EPANET program showing your network map, with the Node ID and Node Pressures displayed on the map, and with the Pipe ID and Pipe Flow Rates on the map.\n",

    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "a)  Make a table that lists each node name, node elevation, and the resultant pressurein U.S. Customary units.\n",

    "b)  Make a table that lists each pipe name,  length,  diameter,  Hazen-Williams coefficient, and the resultant flow rate in U.S. Customary units.\n",

    "c)  Determine the flow rate in each pipe of the network, for the case where the total head at Node 1 is 100 feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)  Determine the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor in each pipe of the network.\n",
