Introduction The title of the course is water systems design. The catalog description is: CE 3372. Water Systems Design (3:3:0).Prerequesite: CE 33051, 33542.Hydraulic analysis and design of municipal water distribution, stormwater collection, and wastewater collection systems. Oral and written presentations. (Writing Intensive) The general scope of the course is: Examination of design guidance documents for drinking water distribution systems, a review of pipeline hydraulics, demand estimation, then a design project related to a drinking water distribution system. The computer program EPANET is presented to provide a tool for the hydraulic modeling component of drinking water system design. Examination of design guidance for stormwater collection systems, presents a review of open channel hydraulics (as related to storm sewers), capacity (hydrology) estimation, then a design project related to a stormwater collection system. The computer program SWMM 5 is presented to provide a tool for the hydrologic/hydraulic modeling component of the stormwater collection system design. Examination of design guidance for wastewater collection systems, then a design project related to a stormwater collection system. The graded components of the course are: Quizzes (administered on a learning management system); individual activity Exercises (collected on a learning management system); group activity Exams (administered on a learning management system); individual activity A design report (Three parts; collected on a learning management system); group activity A design presentation (administered on a learning management system); group activity Water Systems Definition(s) The course title is Water Systems Design, so a natural question is what is meant by a water system? In this course it refers to a water distribution system that conveys raw or treated water to customers, a storm water collection system that conveys storm water away from infrastructure to reduce flooding damages and activities of daily life inconvenience,and wastewater collection systems that convey wastewater to treatment facilities for eventual release of the water back into the environment (or intentional reuse). Water systems can be classified into three main categories (Chin, 2006; Mays, 2011): Water-control systems \u2013 to control the spatial and temporal distribution ofsurface runoff from rainfall events (drainage engineering). They can also servea use role if the captured rainwater is used later on for water supply (rainwaterharvesting). Water-use system \u2013 to support human habitation and include water-treatmentsystems, water-distribution systems, wastewater-collection systems, and wastewater-treatment systems. Environmental restoration system \u2013 to manage spatial and temporal distributionof water (quality and quantity) in support of non-human habitation. Water Control Systems Spatial and temporal distribution of surface runoff from rainfall events (drainage engineering) Flood control Storm water harvesting Capacity is based on AREA served Hydrologicaly dominated designs Water Use Systems Spatial and temporal distribution in support of human habitation Water supply/treatment/distribution Waste water collection/treatment/discharge Capacity is based on POPULATION served Hydraulically dominated designs Environmental Restoration Systems Systems to manage spatial and temporal distribution in support of non-human habitation Create \u201cdesirable\u201d conditions \u201cDesirable\u201d <= Policy <= Value Judgment Water System Photos This brief photo essay is adapted from \u201cHistorical Urban Water Systems\u201d by Dr. Robert Pitt, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 As we proceed through the tour, using the general definitions above, decide whether the picture represents a water control, water use, or environmental restoration system.

In this course it refers to a water distribution system that conveys raw or treated water to customers, a storm water collection system that conveys storm water away from infrastructure to reduce flooding damages and activities of daily life inconvenience,and wastewater collection systems that convey wastewater to treatment facilities for eventual release of the water back into the environment (or intentional reuse). Water systems can be classified into three main categories (Chin, 2006; Mays, 2011): Water-control systems \u2013 to control the spatial and temporal distribution ofsurface runoff from rainfall events (drainage engineering). They can also servea use role if the captured rainwater is used later on for water supply (rainwaterharvesting). Water-use system \u2013 to support human habitation and include water-treatmentsystems, water-distribution systems, wastewater-collection systems, and wastewater-treatment systems.

Sanitary Sewer Hydraulics Concepts Capacity Estimation Inflow Infiltration SWMM Example Collection Systems Collection systems (sewers) are used to collect wastewater and deliver it to a common location. In the case of sanitary wastewater (sewage) that location is some kind of treatment facility For storm-water, that location can often be an outfall to a receiving stream. Collection systems play an important role in the control of water quality, concentrating certain kinds of potential non-point discharges into point discharges, that can be managed more efficiently. The figure below depicts point and non-point sources, generally if you can't point to it it is a non point source in this context. Sewer Types Three main categories are: Sanitary sewer systems \u2014 individual discharges are collected, concentrated (in the volume sense), and delivered to a treatment plant for further processing. Storm sewer systems \u2014 individual discharges are collected, concentrated, and delivered to a receiving water. Combined sewer system (CSS) \u2014 A sanitary system designed to also collect storm-water. New combined systems are not built in the USA ; older cities that were comparatively large in the 1880\u2019s represent the remaining combined systems, and are largely located in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, and around the Great Lakes as depicted in the figure below. The categories share similar hydraulics, namely that of open channel flow, and topologically are similar (comprised of pipes, boxes, junctions, and lift stations) so many design principles are interchangeable, although the sewer\u2019s purposes are different. A sanitary system is to protect public health by isolating wastes from the environment until they can be treated and the reclaimed water released. A storm system is to protect public health by removing nuisance flooding and keeping infrastructure serviceable during all but the most severe weather. In recent decades (since 1990s) storm sewer systems are anticipated to confer water quality benefit, as they are the collectors that capture non-point pollution. Sanitary Sewer Design Sanitary sewers are pipeline systems underground that collect and transmit sewage from distributed sources to a central location. The pipes are typically operated as open channels, that is the pipes are not supposed to flow full, and gravity is the driving force. In some portions of the system, the sewage has to be lifted to maintain flow towards the central plant; these locations are called lift stations , and sewage on the discharge side of the pump flows in a pipe called a force main until the pipe returns to open flow, it is then just a sewage pipe. The rules of design are governed by federal law, state law, and in most cases municipal law. These various laws, codes, and guidelines prescribe materials, joints, labeling, etc. Nearly all sewer systems must be engineered (i.e. a PE is involved with the design), or at least designed by a licensed professional (the professional may not be an engineer in smaller on-site systems, but the design will be stamped with that professional\u2019s credentials.) Sewage Characteristics Five (5-percent solids by mass is typically the upper limit of raw sewage; by volume the percentage is much smaller, perhaps as small as 0.05 percent, thus sewage behaves hydraulically as water. Despite the mostly-water composition, the solids do settle and collect in the system. In times past people would have to go into into the sewers to remove the solids. The figure depicts cleaning of sewers circa 1800\u2019s. Cities like Paris, New York, London, etc. have large diameter sewers that probably still require occassional personnel access. The design engineer is concerned with the sewage quality insofar as it affects corrosion and safety to the maintenance personnel. For example, in the Texas code, there is some discussion of corrosion and odor issues: For example, in the Texas code, there is some discussion of corrosion and odor issues: Corrosion potential: If a pipe or an integral structural component of a pipe will deteriorate when subjected to corrosive internal conditions or if a pipe or component does not have a corrosive resistant liner installed by the pipe manufacturer, the report must demonstrate the structural integrity of a pipe during the minimum 50-year design life cycle. A pipe must have an appropriate lining if the corrosion analysis indicates that corrosion will reduce the functional life of the pipe to less than 50 years. there is also discussion of corrosion and odor issues: Odor Control. (a) An owner shall determine if odor control measures are necessary to prevent a wastewater collection system from becoming a nuisance, based upon the potential of the wastewater collection system to generate hydrogen sulfide. (b) A potential odor determination must include the estimated flows immediately following construction and throughout a system\u2019s 50-year expected life cycle. Sewage quantity Quantity (how much?) is estimated in a similar fashion as water demand. Small residential service area flows are estimated based on population or equivalent residential units and per-person contribution to wastewater generation. Larger service area flows are estimated from land use (zoning), anticipated population, and similar nearby measured flows. In-system sewage is not routinely measured, but short-term studies (2-months) are well within the capabilities of most jurisdictions, flow measurement is by weirs, magmeters, and acoustic-Doppler profiling. For example, in Texas the design flow basis is: An owner must design a wastewater collection system to handle the transport of the peak dry weather flow from the service area, plus infiltration and inflow. The flow calculations must include the details of the average dry weather flow, the dry weather flow peaking factor, and the infiltration and inflow. The flow calculations must include the flow expected in the facility immediately upon completion of construction and at the end of its 50-year life. Some further requirements are: An owner must ensure that a wastewater collection system\u2019s capacity is sufficient to serve the estimated future population, including institutional, industrial, and commercial flows. An owner must include in the report the calculations that demonstrate that the hydraulic capacity of a collection system includes the peak flow of domes- tic sewage, peak flow of waste from industrial sites, and maximum infiltration rates. A collection system must be designed to prevent a surcharge in any pipe at the expected peak flow. The minimum diameter allowed for a gravity pipe is 6.0 inches. Connecting storm water drains to a collection system is prohibited. An owner may use the data from an existing collection system. In the absence of existing data, a design must use data from a similar system or as described below: The sizing of pipe for a new collection system must be based on an engineering analysis of initial and future flows. A new collection system design must be sized for the peak flow, which is based on the estimated daily sewage flow contribution as shown in Figure 4 ( a copy from the Texas code is below) Readings \"Wastewater Collection Systems\" in Land Development Handbook, Ed.

In the case of sanitary wastewater (sewage) that location is some kind of treatment facility For storm-water, that location can often be an outfall to a receiving stream. Collection systems play an important role in the control of water quality, concentrating certain kinds of potential non-point discharges into point discharges, that can be managed more efficiently. The figure below depicts point and non-point sources, generally if you can't point to it it is a non point source in this context.","title":"Collection Systems"},{"location":"lesson26/lesson26/#sewer-types","text":"Three main categories are: Sanitary sewer systems \u2014 individual discharges are collected, concentrated (in the volume sense), and delivered to a treatment plant for further processing. Storm sewer systems \u2014 individual discharges are collected, concentrated, and delivered to a receiving water. Combined sewer system (CSS) \u2014 A sanitary system designed to also collect storm-water. New combined systems are not built in the USA ; older cities that were comparatively large in the 1880\u2019s represent the remaining combined systems, and are largely located in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, and around the Great Lakes as depicted in the figure below. The categories share similar hydraulics, namely that of open channel flow, and topologically are similar (comprised of pipes, boxes, junctions, and lift stations) so many design principles are interchangeable, although the sewer\u2019s purposes are different. A sanitary system is to protect public health by isolating wastes from the environment until they can be treated and the reclaimed water released. A storm system is to protect public health by removing nuisance flooding and keeping infrastructure serviceable during all but the most severe weather. In recent decades (since 1990s) storm sewer systems are anticipated to confer water quality benefit, as they are the collectors that capture non-point pollution.","title":"Sewer Types"},{"location":"lesson26/lesson26/#sanitary-sewer-design","text":"Sanitary sewers are pipeline systems underground that collect and transmit sewage from distributed sources to a central location. The pipes are typically operated as open channels, that is the pipes are not supposed to flow full, and gravity is the driving force. In some portions of the system, the sewage has to be lifted to maintain flow towards the central plant; these locations are called lift stations , and sewage on the discharge side of the pump flows in a pipe called a force main until the pipe returns to open flow, it is then just a sewage pipe. The rules of design are governed by federal law, state law, and in most cases municipal law. These various laws, codes, and guidelines prescribe materials, joints, labeling, etc. Nearly all sewer systems must be engineered (i.e. a PE is involved with the design), or at least designed by a licensed professional (the professional may not be an engineer in smaller on-site systems, but the design will be stamped with that professional\u2019s credentials.)","title":"Sanitary Sewer Design"},{"location":"lesson26/lesson26/#sewage-characteristics","text":"Five (5-percent solids by mass is typically the upper limit of raw sewage; by volume the percentage is much smaller, perhaps as small as 0.05 percent, thus sewage behaves hydraulically as water. Despite the mostly-water composition, the solids do settle and collect in the system. In times past people would have to go into into the sewers to remove the solids. The figure depicts cleaning of sewers circa 1800\u2019s. Cities like Paris, New York, London, etc. have large diameter sewers that probably still require occassional personnel access. The design engineer is concerned with the sewage quality insofar as it affects corrosion and safety to the maintenance personnel. For example, in the Texas code, there is some discussion of corrosion and odor issues: For example, in the Texas code, there is some discussion of corrosion and odor issues: Corrosion potential: If a pipe or an integral structural component of a pipe will deteriorate when subjected to corrosive internal conditions or if a pipe or component does not have a corrosive resistant liner installed by the pipe manufacturer, the report must demonstrate the structural integrity of a pipe during the minimum 50-year design life cycle. A pipe must have an appropriate lining if the corrosion analysis indicates that corrosion will reduce the functional life of the pipe to less than 50 years. there is also discussion of corrosion and odor issues: Odor Control. (a) An owner shall determine if odor control measures are necessary to prevent a wastewater collection system from becoming a nuisance, based upon the potential of the wastewater collection system to generate hydrogen sulfide. (b) A potential odor determination must include the estimated flows immediately following construction and throughout a system\u2019s 50-year expected life cycle.","title":"Sewage Characteristics"},{"location":"lesson26/lesson26/#sewage-quantity","text":"Quantity (how much?) is estimated in a similar fashion as water demand. Small residential service area flows are estimated based on population or equivalent residential units and per-person contribution to wastewater generation. Larger service area flows are estimated from land use (zoning), anticipated population, and similar nearby measured flows. In-system sewage is not routinely measured, but short-term studies (2-months) are well within the capabilities of most jurisdictions, flow measurement is by weirs, magmeters, and acoustic-Doppler profiling. For example, in Texas the design flow basis is: An owner must design a wastewater collection system to handle the transport of the peak dry weather flow from the service area, plus infiltration and inflow. The flow calculations must include the details of the average dry weather flow, the dry weather flow peaking factor, and the infiltration and inflow. The flow calculations must include the flow expected in the facility immediately upon completion of construction and at the end of its 50-year life. Some further requirements are: An owner must ensure that a wastewater collection system\u2019s capacity is sufficient to serve the estimated future population, including institutional, industrial, and commercial flows. An owner must include in the report the calculations that demonstrate that the hydraulic capacity of a collection system includes the peak flow of domes- tic sewage, peak flow of waste from industrial sites, and maximum infiltration rates. A collection system must be designed to prevent a surcharge in any pipe at the expected peak flow. The minimum diameter allowed for a gravity pipe is 6.0 inches. Connecting storm water drains to a collection system is prohibited. An owner may use the data from an existing collection system. In the absence of existing data, a design must use data from a similar system or as described below: The sizing of pipe for a new collection system must be based on an engineering analysis of initial and future flows. A new collection system design must be sized for the peak flow, which is based on the estimated daily sewage flow contribution as shown in Figure 4 ( a copy from the Texas code is below)","title":"Sewage quantity"},{"location":"lesson26/lesson26/#readings","text":"\"Wastewater Collection Systems\" in Land Development Handbook, Ed.

Should that be necessary, students will be advised of technical and/or equipment requirements, including remote proctoring software. Policy on absences resulting from illness: We anticipate that some students may have extended absences. To avoid students feeling compelled to attend in-person class periods when having symptoms or feeling unwell, a standard policy is provided that holds students harmless for illness-related absences (see Section A below). A. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Face-to-Face Classes) If at any time during the semester you are ill, in the interest of your own health and safety as well as the health and safety of your instructors and classmates, you are encouraged not to attend face-to-face class meetings or events. Please review the steps outlined below that you should follow to ensure your absence for illness will be excused. These steps also apply to not participating in synchronous online class meetings if you feel too ill to do so and missing specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes because of illness. If you are ill and think the symptoms might be COVID-19-related: Call Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider. During after-hours and on weekends, contact TTU COVID-19 Helpline at TBD. Self-report as soon as possible using the Dean of Students COVID-19 webpage. This website has specific directions about how to upload documentation from a medical provider and what will happen if your illness renders you unable to participate in classes for more than one week. If your illness is determined to be COVID-19-related, all remaining documentation and communication will be handled through the Office of the Dean of Students, including notification of your instructors of the time you may be absent from and may return to classes. If your illness is determined not to be COVID-19-related, please follow steps 2.a-d below. If you are ill and can attribute your symptoms to something other than COVID-19: If your illness renders you unable to attend face-to-face classes, participate in synchronous online classes, or miss specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes, you are encouraged to contact either Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider. Note that Student Health Services and your own and other health care providers may arrange virtual visits. During the health provider visit, request a \u201creturn to school\u201d note. E-mail the instructor a picture of that note. Return to class by the next class period after the date indicated on your note. Following the steps outlined above helps to keep your instructors informed about your absences and ensures your absence or missing an assignment due date because of illness will be marked excused. You will still be responsible to complete within a week of returning to class any assignments, quizzes, or exams you miss because of illness. B. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Telepresence/On-Line Classes) Same as above with respect potential to infect others; go to a health care provider if you are ill. Telepresence courses are recorded and will be available on TTU MediaSite and/or YouTube (unlisted). Exercises, Quizzes, and Examinations are all administered by a Learning Management System (Blackboard) and students need to allow enough time to complete and upload their work. Due date adjustments/late submits on case-by-case basis; documentation required as in subsection A above.

Telepresence (On-line) Courses Obviously electronic devices are vital; disrupting the conference is prohibited, please mute your microphone unless you have a question - consider typing your question into the chat window as well. Be aware of bandwidth issues and remember most lessons and laboratory sessions are recorded and posted on youtube. Recording, editing, and rendering takes awhile, so expect 24-36 hour delay before video is available. ADA Statement: Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet the course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements. Students must present appropriate verification from Student Disability Services during the instructor's office hours. Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from Student Disability Services has been provided. For additional information, please contact Student Disability Services office in 335 West Hall or call 806.742.2405. Academic Integrity Statement: Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one\u2019s own class and/or course work, being individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior. Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility. Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect. Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured. Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors. Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning. Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly. Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers. [Texas Tech University (\u201cUniversity\u201d) Quality Enhancement Plan, Academic Integrity Task Force, 2010]. Religious Holy Day Statement: \u201cReligious holy day\u201d means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code \u00a711.20. A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known to the instructor prior to the absence. A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence. A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily. Ethical Conduct Policy: Cheating is prohibited, and the representation of the work of another person as your own will be grounds for receiving a failing grade in the course. DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE STATEMENT: Texas Tech University is committed to providing and strengthening an educational, working, and living environment where students, faculty, staff, and visitors are free from gender and/or sex discrimination of any kind. Sexual assault, discrimination, harassment, and other Title IX violations are not tolerated by the University. Report any incidents to the Office for Student Rights & Resolution, (806)-742-SAFE (7233) or file a report online at titleix.ttu.edu/students. Faculty and staff members at TTU are committed to connecting you to resources on campus.

CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM STATEMENT: Texas Tech University is a community of faculty, students, and staff that enjoys an expectation of cooperation, professionalism, and civility during the conduct of all forms of university business, including the conduct of student\u2013student and student\u2013faculty interactions in and out of the classroom. Further, the classroom is a setting in which an exchange of ideas and creative thinking should be encouraged and where intellectual growth and development are fostered. Students who disrupt this classroom mission by rude, sarcastic, threatening, abusive or obscene language and/or behavior will be subject to appropriate sanctions according to university policy. Likewise, faculty members are expected to maintain the highest standards of professionalism in all interactions with all constituents of the university. To ensure that you are fully engaged in class discussions and account team meetings during class time, you are expected to do the following: - Maintain the same level of civility and professionalism that would be expected in a face-to-face classroom setting. - Attend all classes regularly. - Log into the video conference on time and remain logged in for the duration of the class period. - Activate your camera so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class. If you have concerns about leaving your camera on (such as childcare obligations, privacy issues, or a particular circumstance during a class period), please talk to the instructor. - Refrain from engaging in non-class related activities during class time that create a distraction for other students in the class and/or limit your ability to engage in the course. Failure to meet these expectations may result in the following consequences: 1. Being counted as absent for the class meeting. 2. Not receiving credit for class participation for that class period. 3. Other consequences as stipulated in the syllabus, Texas Tech Code of Student Conduct, or other university policy. Repeated failure to meet expectations (e.g., attendance, participation in class, etc.), in addition to the above consequences, may result in the one or more of the following consequences: 1. Referral to the appropriate Associate Dean. 2. Academic penalty, ranging from a warning to failure of the course. (www.depts.ttu.edu/ethics/matadorchallenge/ethicalprinciples.php).

Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility. Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect. Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured. Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors. Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning. Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly. Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers.

CIVILITY IN THE CLASSROOM STATEMENT: Texas Tech University is a community of faculty, students, and staff that enjoys an expectation of cooperation, professionalism, and civility during the conduct of all forms of university business, including the conduct of student\u2013student and student\u2013faculty interactions in and out of the classroom. Further, the classroom is a setting in which an exchange of ideas and creative thinking should be encouraged and where intellectual growth and development are fostered. Students who disrupt this classroom mission by rude, sarcastic, threatening, abusive or obscene language and/or behavior will be subject to appropriate sanctions according to university policy. Likewise, faculty members are expected to maintain the highest standards of professionalism in all interactions with all constituents of the university. To ensure that you are fully engaged in class discussions and account team meetings during class time, you are expected to do the following: - Maintain the same level of civility and professionalism that would be expected in a face-to-face classroom setting. - Attend all classes regularly. - Log into the video conference on time and remain logged in for the duration of the class period. - Activate your camera so that you are visible to the instructor and other students in the class. If you have concerns about leaving your camera on (such as childcare obligations, privacy issues, or a particular circumstance during a class period), please talk to the instructor. - Refrain from engaging in non-class related activities during class time that create a distraction for other students in the class and/or limit your ability to engage in the course. Failure to meet these expectations may result in the following consequences: 1. Being counted as absent for the class meeting. 2. Not receiving credit for class participation for that class period. 3. Other consequences as stipulated in the syllabus, Texas Tech Code of Student Conduct, or other university policy. Repeated failure to meet expectations (e.g., attendance, participation in class, etc.), in addition to the above consequences, may result in the one or more of the following consequences: 1. Referral to the appropriate Associate Dean. 2. Academic penalty, ranging from a warning to failure of the course. (www.depts.ttu.edu/ethics/matadorchallenge/ethicalprinciples.php).
