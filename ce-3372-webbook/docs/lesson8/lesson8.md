## CE 3372 Water Systems Design
### Lesson 8. Storage Systems

Storage is used in water supply, storm water management, and wastewater systems for several reasons. 

**SERVICE STORAGE**  
1. Flow equalization — generally things are designed for a particular steady flow rate and storage can be used to accommodate variable flow rates in a system. 
2. Pressure zone maintenance 

**EMERGENCY STORAGE**  
1. used to provide supply during repairs and other system interrupts (except fire suppression)

**FIRE STORAGE**  
1. used to provide supply during fire fighting activities – considered seperately from emergency storage
