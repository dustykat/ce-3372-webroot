Water Systems Design (3:3:0).Prerequesite: CE 33051, 33542.Hydraulic analysis and design of municipal water distribution, stormwater collection, and wastewater collection systems.  Oral and written presenta-tions.  (Writing Intensive)\n",
    "\n",
    "The general scope of the course is:\n",
    "- Examination of design guidance documents for drinking water distribution systems, a review of pipeline hydraulics, demand estimation, then a design project related to a drinking water distribution system. \n",
    "- The computer program EPANET is presented to provide a tool for the hydraulic modeling component of drinking water system design.\n",
    "- Examination of design guidance for stormwater collection systems, presents a review of open channel hydraulics (as related to storm sewers),  capacity (hydrology)  estimation,  then  a  design  project  related  to  a  stormwater  collection system.\n",
    "- The computer program SWMM 5 is presented to provide a tool for the hydrologic/hydraulic modeling component of the stormwater collection system design.\n",
    "- Examination of design guidance for wastewater collection systems, then  a  design  project  related  to  a  stormwater  collection system.\n",

    "### Water Systems Definition(s)\n",
    "The course title is Water Systems Design, so a natural question is what is meant by a water system?  In this course it refers to a water distribution system that conveys raw or treated water to customers, a storm water collection system that conveys storm water away from infrastructure to reduce flooding damages and activities of daily life inconvenience,and wastewater collection systems that convey wastewater to treatment facilities for eventual release of the water back into the environment (or intentional reuse).\n",
    "\n",
    "Water systems can be classified into three main categories (Chin, 2006; Mays, 2011):\n",
    "1.  Water-control  systems  –  to  control  the  spatial  and  temporal  distribution  ofsurface runoff from rainfall events (drainage engineering).  They can also servea use role if the captured rainwater is used later on for water supply (rainwaterharvesting).\n",
    "2.  Water-use system – to support human habitation and include water-treatmentsystems, water-distribution systems, wastewater-collection systems, and wastewater-treatment systems.\n",
    "3.  Environmental restoration system – to manage spatial and temporal distributionof water (quality and quantity) in support of non-human habitation."
