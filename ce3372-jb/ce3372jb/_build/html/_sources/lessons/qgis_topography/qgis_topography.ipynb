    "## What is QGIS?\n",
    "\n",
    "QGIS, or Quantum GIS, is an open-source geographic information system (GIS) software that allows users to view, edit, and analyze geospatial data. Here's an overview of its history, recent state, and common uses:\n",
    "\n",
    ">QGIS was first released in 2002 by Gary Sherman as an open-source alternative to proprietary GIS software.\n",
    "Over the years, it has evolved through contributions from a global community of developers, becoming a powerful and user-friendly GIS tool.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> As of January 2022, QGIS was still being actively developed, with regular updates and releases.  The software has a large user community that contributes to its improvement and the development of plugins to extend its functionality.  Features are continually added and enhanced, making it a competitive option in the GIS software landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Visualization: QGIS allows users to create maps and visualize geospatial data in various formats, such as shapefiles, GeoJSON, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Editing: Users can edit and digitize spatial data directly within the software, making it useful for tasks like updating maps or correcting geographical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spatial Analysis: QGIS provides a wide range of tools for spatial analysis, including proximity analysis, overlay analysis, and statistical analysis, aiding in decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map Design: The software includes tools for designing aesthetically pleasing maps with customizable symbology, labels, and layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integration: QGIS supports the integration of various data sources, including GPS data, remote sensing data, and data from online services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plugins and Extensions: The availability of plugins and extensions allows users to customize and extend the functionality of QGIS based on their specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Source: Being open source, QGIS is free to use, and its source code is accessible to developers, encouraging collaboration and continuous improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more at the [official QGIS website](https://qgis.org/en/site/).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} \n",
    "Here are useful QGIC GitHub links:\n",
    "- [The website itself](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Website)\n",
    "- [Documentation](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation)\n",
    "- [Download(s)](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS)\n",
    "Your best bet is probably to work through the [official QGIS website](https://qgis.org/en/site/).\n",

    "## Why QGIS instead of ESRI products? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have already used the University-ble\\$\\$ed ESRI GIS products in GIST 3300/5300 Geographic Information Systems, or other [GIS-based courses at TTU](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/geosciences/geog/research/gist.php), and wonder why I choose QGIS.  The two main reasons are:\n",
    "1. QGIS is Open Source (I am a cheap).\n",
    "2. It will run in some form without much fuss on a PC, MAC (both intel, and Apple silicon), and in Linux (on intel/amd and arm silicon). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have ESRI-based GIS tools use them, no good reason to install a second GIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note} Several other factors may influence someone to choose QGIS over other similar GIS (Geographic Information System) tools. Here are some reasons why individuals and organizations might prefer QGIS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open Source and Free: QGIS is open-source software, meaning it is free to use and distribute. This can be a significant advantage for users or organizations with budget constraints, as it provides powerful GIS capabilities without the need for a substantial financial investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Active Community Support: QGIS has a vibrant and active user community. This community contributes to the development of the software, creates plugins, and provides support through forums and documentation. The availability of community support can be valuable for users seeking assistance or looking to extend QGIS's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-Platform Compatibility: QGIS is designed to run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This cross-platform compatibility makes it accessible to users with different operating system preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- User-Friendly Interface: QGIS is known for its user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced GIS professionals. The software employs an intuitive layout and design, facilitating ease of use for those new to GIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extensive Functionality: QGIS offers a broad range of tools and features for data visualization, editing, and analysis. Its functionality is comparable to many proprietary GIS tools, and it continues to evolve with regular updates and new releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plugin System: QGIS has a robust plugin system that allows users to enhance and extend the software's capabilities. Users can install plugins to add specific functionalities tailored to their needs, making QGIS adaptable to a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interoperability: QGIS supports various data formats and standards, ensuring compatibility with data from different sources. This interoperability makes it easier to integrate QGIS into existing workflows and work with diverse geospatial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customization: Users can customize QGIS to suit their specific requirements. This includes customizing symbology, creating tailored layouts, and utilizing plugins to add specialized tools, making QGIS adaptable to a variety of use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the choice between GIS tools depends on the specific needs, preferences, and constraints of the user or organization. QGIS's open-source nature, community support, and extensive functionality make it a compelling choice for many GIS users.\n",
