# # Pumping Systems
# 
# Water moves from higher to lower energy
# - Path of least resistance
# - Head is energy per unit weight of a fluid 
# - Pumps are used to add energy to move water to a higher elevation, or over a barrier, or to increase system pressure. 
# 

# ## Background
#  
# A pump is a mechanical device that transfers energy into a liquid; used to 
# 
# - Lift from lower to higher elevation (Lift stations)
# - Increase pressure (Booster stations)

# 
# The gas phase equivalent is a Compressor 

# Pumps range substantially in size depending on application
# 
# - Small <br>

# - Big <br>

# ## Types
# 
# Positive (Fixed) Displacement Pumps 
# - Fixed volume of fluid is displaced each cycle regardless of 
# system static head/pressure 
# - Lower flow rates and higher head than non-positive pumps 
# 
# Variable Displacement Pumps  
# - Varying volume of fluid is displaced dependent on system static 
# head/pressure (back pressure) 
# 
# Fixed Displacement Pumps 
# - Screw Pumps ![](screwpump.png) 
# - Progressive Cavity Pumps ![](cavitypump.png)
# - Reciprocating Pumps ![](pistonpump.png)
# 
# 
# 
# Variable Displacement Pumps 
# - Centrifugal (Radial-Flow) Pumps 
# - Propeller Pumps (Axial-Flow) 
# - Jet Pumps (Mixed-Flow)
