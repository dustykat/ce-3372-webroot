# ## Linking Systems 
# 
# A hydraulic system can be analysed as a set of linked components to make an otherwise complicated system easier to analyze.
# 
# - Idea is to decompose into smaller (hydraulically) independent parts, analyze the parts then reassemble (integrate) the parts to answer questions about the whole system
# 
# ### Example: Rural Water Supply to a Village School

# The figure is an aerial image of a pipeline system with preliminary engineering sketches of the system (lower left panel) and a detail sketch of the terminal small storage tank (upper right panel). The 3,200 meter long pipeline lifts 25C water ( $\rho= 997 kg/m^3$,$\nu= 8.94 E-7 m^2/s$) from a treatment plant on the downstream face of Gulameta Dam through a 127 millimeter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe (ks =0.0015 mm) to a large diameter at-grade cylindrical storage tank. A secondary, 800 meter long pipeline carries water from the large diameter storage tank to a small, cylindrical (D = 1 meter), elevated storage tank at the village school. Both storage tanks have float valves to prevent overflow and maintain the indicated water pool elevations.
# 
# Analyze proposed system to determine anticipated behavior under various situations:
# 
# - Float valve fails at school
# - Outlet valve accidently left open
# - Pump operation under worst failure mode
# - Pump fails, time until system fails/drains
# - Float valve limited
# - Oultet valve limited
