# # Lesson 7. Storage Systems
# 
# Storage is used in water supply, storm water management, and wastewater systems for several reasons. 
# 
# ## Scale
# 
# There are several scales of storage: 
# - large (water supply reservoirs, like Lake Allen Henry)

# - moderate (Southwest Lubbock Water Treatment)

# - localized (storage tanks,  )

# The large scale systems are sized using water resources management principles, which are discussed to some extent in Gupta pp. 545-548.  The usual tool is called a ripple-chart or double mass curve (same thing, different names).  In local scale an identical tool is used, but at a much different (hourly) time-scale.

# ## Local Scale
# 
# The remainder of this chapter will focus on the local scale systems.  At the local scale (Gupta pp. 548-553) we are concerned with three categories of storage:
#     
# **SERVICE STORAGE**  
# 1. Flow equalization — generally things are designed for a particular steady flow rate and storage can be used to accommodate variable flow rates in a system. 
# 2. Pressure zone maintenance 
# 
# **EMERGENCY STORAGE**  
# 1. used to provide supply during repairs and other system interrupts (except fire suppression)
# 
# **FIRE STORAGE**  
# 1. used to provide supply during fire fighting activities – considered seperately from emergency storage
