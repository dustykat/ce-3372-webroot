# # Lesson 7. Storage Systems
# 
# Storage is used in water supply, storm water management, and wastewater systems for several reasons. 
# 
# **SERVICE STORAGE**  
# 1. Flow equalization — generally things are designed for a particular steady flow rate and storage can be used to accommodate variable flow rates in a system. 
# 2. Pressure zone maintenance 
# 
# **EMERGENCY STORAGE**  
# 1. used to provide supply during repairs and other system interrupts (except fire suppression)
# 
# **FIRE STORAGE**  
# 1. used to provide supply during fire fighting activities – considered seperately from emergency storage
