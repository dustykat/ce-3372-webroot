    "\n",
    "EPA-NET is a computer program that performs hydraulics computations in pressure-pipe systems. \n",
    "Most of the problems in the preceding chapters can be solved or well approximated using EPA-NET.\n",
    "The remainder of this lesson shows how to use EPA-NET by a series of representative examples. \n",
    "These examples are at best a subset of the capabilities of the program, but should be enough to get one started. \n",
    "The program requires some hydraulic insight to interpret the results as well as detect data entry or conceptualization errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "EPA-NET models are comprised of nodes, links,and reservoirs. \n",
    "Pumps are treated as special links (that add head). \n",
    "Valves are also treated as special links depending on the valve types.\n",
    "All **working** models must have a reservoir (or storage tank)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The program has certain defaults that should be set at the beginning of a simulation. \n",
    "The main defaults of importance are the head loss equations (Darcy-Weisbach, Hazen-Williams, or Chezy-Manning) and the flow units (CFS, LPS, etc.)\n",

    "### Example 1: Flow in a Single Pipe \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest model to consider is from an earlier exercise in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A 5-foot diameter, enamel coated, steel pipe carries $60^o$F water at a discharge of 295 cubic-feet per second (cfs). <br>\n",
    "> Using the Moody chart, estimate the head loss in a 10,000 foot length of this pipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In EPANET we will start the program, build a tank-pipe system and find the head loss in\n",
    "a 10,000 foot length of the pipe. The program will compute the friction factor for us (and\n",
    "we can check on the Moody chart if we wish).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main trick in EPA-NET is going to be the friction coefficient, in the EPA-NET manual\n",
    "on page 30 and 31, the author indicates that the program expects a roughness coefficient\n",
    "based on the head loss equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The units of the roughness coefficient for a steel pipe are 0.15 × 10−3 feet. \n",
    "These can be found from various sources such as [Roughness Height](http://54.243.252.9/toolbox/Databases/RoughnessHeight/RoughnessHeight.html) \n",
    "On page 71 of the user manual the author states that roughness coefficients are in millifeet (millimeters) when the Darcy-Weisbach head loss model is used. \n",
    "So keeping that in mind we proceed with the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program starts as a blank slate and we will select a reservoir and a node from the tool bar\n",
    "at the top and place these onto the design canvas.\n",
