    "### Suction Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common cause of pumping system failure is poor suction conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cavitation occurs when liquid pressure is reduced to the vapor pressure of the liquid, then the liquid flashes to make small gas bubbles, which are unstable and collapse back into liquid - this rapid localized phase change process imparts large destructive energy into the pump impeller and housing and quickly destroys the pump itself in addition to creating loss of priming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a pipe system with a pump, cavitation will occur when the absolute pressure at the inlet (eye) falls below the vapor pressure of the water.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "The pump destruction described is not usually instant, but does happen pretty fast.  For example weeks to failure when the designer expects years between overhauls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "High speed turbopumps  can fail in seconds when they are supposed to run for minutes.  Cavitation is a big deal in things like rocket ships, nuclear power plants (cooling system), and other high-risk applications; less so in Civil Engineering, usually our failures just cost time and money - a lift station failure during a flood could cause death, so we are not risk-free\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations \n",
    "- Liquid must enter the pump eye under some pressure; this pressure is dictated by the hydraulic system and is called the Available Net Positive Suction Head $NPSH_a$.\n",
    "- A centrifugal pump cannot lift water unless it is primed; the first stage impellers must be below the static HGL in the suction pit at startup.\n",
    "- The manufacturer supplies a value for the minimum pressure the pump needs to operate; this pressure is called the Required Net Positive Suction Head $NPSH_r$\n",
    "- Proper pump operation without cavitation demands that $$ NPSH_r < NPSH_a $$\n",

    "- Find operating point\n",
    "- Judge if there is some excess head and/or flow available (this would be desirable)\n",
    "- Judge if close to best possible efficiency for the pump (can vary a little, but it would be dumb to operate a piss-po efficiency)\n",
    "- Check suction conditions at startup and operation\n",
