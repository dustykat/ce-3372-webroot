File is not typeset, it is an image.  The reading program cannot parse the file.

You need to get away from handwriting and typeset your answers.

EEWeb and similar tools (ReMarkable, OneNote, ...) are workable - they convert your handwriting into digital text (in the background).  If you insist on handwritten content use one of these tools.
Submission Issue: Unreadable Handwritten PDF

Thank you for submitting "CE 3372 ES1.pdf." However, this file appears to be a photographed or scanned handwritten document without machine-readable text. As a result, it cannot be processed effectively for evaluation.
Why is This an Issue?

    OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is required to extract text from scanned images, but this file does not appear to contain recognized digital text.
    Handwriting may be inconsistent or unclear, leading to incorrect interpretations if OCR is attempted.
    Evaluation tools rely on machine-readable text to compare your submission against the solution file and provide detailed feedback.

How to Submit a Machine-Readable PDF:

To ensure your work is properly evaluated, consider using one of these methods:

    Typeset the Document and Save as PDF
        Use Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LaTeX to write your responses.
        Save the final document as a PDF file before submitting.

    Use an OCR-Compatible Writing Tool
        If you prefer handwriting, use a tablet with OCR support, such as:
            EEWeb, ReMarkable, OneNote, GoodNotes, or Notability
            These tools convert handwriting to digital text before saving as a PDF.

    Use a High-Quality OCR Scanner
        If you must scan a handwritten document, ensure it is processed with OCR software like:
            Adobe Acrobat (OCR feature)
            CamScanner (with OCR enabled)
            Google Drive (Scan with OCR option)

Next Steps:
