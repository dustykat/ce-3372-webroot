    "Designing drinking water supply and treatment systems is a complex process that requires careful attention to a wide range of factors, including demand estimation, water source protection, treatment processes, storage, and distribution. Engineers must ensure that systems are designed to meet current and future demand while maintaining water quality and public health standards. To guide this process, various design manuals and standards, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) Manuals and the Ten States Standards, provide comprehensive guidelines on the planning, design, and construction of water supply and treatment facilities. These guides cover everything from pipe sizing and pump station design to water treatment plant processes and distribution network hydraulics, helping engineers adhere to best practices and regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of drinking water system design is hydraulics, which governs how water flows through pipes, pumps, and treatment processes. Hydraulics is essential for determining the correct pipe sizes, pump capacities, and tank elevations required to maintain adequate pressure and flow throughout the system. For instance, the design of a distribution network must consider head losses due to friction in pipes, and ensure that water reaches all consumers at a sufficient pressure, typically between 40 and 80 psi. Tools such as Bernoulliâ€™s equation and the Manning formula are commonly used to calculate these parameters, allowing engineers to optimize system efficiency while ensuring that water quality is maintained through proper residence time in storage tanks and pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In treatment plant design, hydraulic considerations also play a crucial role in the functioning of various processes, such as filtration, sedimentation, and chemical dosing. Each treatment stage must be designed to accommodate the flow rate of incoming raw water and ensure that the water is adequately treated before entering the distribution system. Hydraulic grade lines (HGL) and energy considerations are used to design systems that allow for gravity flow where possible, minimizing the need for excessive pumping and reducing operational costs. The layout of treatment facilities, including the placement of pumps, tanks, and pipelines, is dictated by hydraulic design to ensure the smooth movement of water through the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, surge protection and transient analysis are vital in large-scale water distribution systems to prevent water hammer effects, which can cause damage to pipes and valves when sudden changes in flow or pressure occur. Detailed hydraulic modeling, often using software such as EPANET or WaterGEMS, allows engineers to simulate real-world conditions, optimize system design, and ensure long-term reliability.\n",

    "A water distribution system's design is crucial to providing customers with good water quality at an acceptable pressure level. A good distribution system configuration also helps meet the required water demands and limit the number of customers who run out of water during outages. The three most common distribution design configurations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arterial loop systems. This design surrounds the distribution system with a large-diameter water main that provides adequate flow to the interconnecting distribution system from different locations. This layout design creates greater flexibility by supplying water to the distribution system from multiple locations.\n",
    "- Grid systems. This configuration allows water to circulate through the entire system, which is typically fed by an arterial main or a single transmission line. The layout structure distributes water to multiple areas with better quality, pressure and flow rate.\n",

    "Below, are some important factors that can influence conceptual or design decisions for water system upgrades or replacements, and aspects to consider while developing system layout plans. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning a water distribution system design: factors to consider\n",
    "Whether a community needs an upgrade, an expansion or a replacement system, planning is critical for designing an effective water distribution system. Beyond primary concerns, like availability, reliability and quality of water in an area, the community size, type and average usage can also guide water distribution system designs. After initial project review comes layout and permitting, followed by design plans and production. Construction only commences after these planning stages are complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "Design elements can be significantly influenced by certain factors. The table below lists important details to consider, and explains why and how they might shape the initial designs of a water system during the planning stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "|FACTOR |WHY |HOW|\n",
    "|:::|:::|:::|\n",
    "|Age|- Built in the 1970s and 1980s, the average water network pipe is about 45 years old. <br> - Some U.S. systems have pipes older that one century.|Replacing worn components in older systems must be a priority.|\n",
    "|Geography/climate|-Extreme temperatures, topography, elevation, soil composition and local geology influence decisions about installation and materials.|- Varying elevations need greater pumping capacity than flat terrain.<br>- Freezing temperatures influence choice of pipe materials and installation depth.|\n",
    "|Water usage |- Partial service line replacements may increase lead levels in drinking water if they disturb lead-bearing pipe scale <br>- Scale, the build-up of minerals coating pipe interiors affects hydraulics.<br><br>| -Critical factors affecting distribution pipe size and storage and pumping facility size include:<br>- Average Day Demand.<br>- Peak Hour Demand.<br>- Fire Flow Demand.<br>More demand = greater capacity.|\n",
    "|Environmental requirements|- Local, state and federal regulations dictate minimum drinking water quality.<br>- System design standards may include permits for installation, excavation and offset distances from other facilities.|- Designs must meet state and local standards for water quality and distribution systems, which may differ from federal regulations.\n",
    "|Project budget|- Building or expanding water distribution systems is an expensive project that requires significant funding.|- The project budget in terms of funding and costs determines the scope of the project. <br> Funding could be shared by the customers or funded through grants or government revolving loan programs. <br> - More money = broader scope.|\n",
    "Demand forecasts|- Projections for population growth and fire protection requirements should influence designs for water distribution systems.|Design plans must include elements of expansibility to accommodate increasing populations. <br> - More money = broader scope.|\n",
    "\n",
    "These initial design considerations, in turn, determine the layout of a water distribution system. Below, are some common system layout types, configurations and the roles of various appurtenances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key aspects of water distribution layout design\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of a water distribution system involves input from several teams, including the utility engineering department, engineering consultants, distribution operators or field operators, and others. Most design input focuses on the logistics and implementation of a water distribution system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layout**\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution layout of a water system includes disinfection treatment facilities, pipelines (mains and services), and appurtenances like valves and fire hydrants. Engineers typically calculate a water system distribution layout using parameters like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flow rate.\n",
    "- Water demands.\n",
    "- Pressure.\n",
    "- Other Utilities.\n",
    "- Material selection.\n",
    "- Municipal ordinances.\n",
    "- Flow velocity.\n",
    "- Fire flow requirements.\n",
    "- Topography.\n",
    "- Construction budget/funding.\n",
    "- Right-of-way limitations.\n",
    "- Environmental regulations/requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that several of these parameters are usually considered during the initial planning phase, but input from field operators can help refine layout design calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that most of the manuals (above) spend considerable space explaining how \n",
    "drawings are to be submitted for approval.  The actual layout is flexible (within right-of-way) and up to the hydraulic \n",
    "engineer to some extent. \n",
    "\n",
    "A designer would typically use some version of the following workflow to design a water distribution system: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up the distribution system grid on the area plan. Aerial photo plots to scale are excellent tools \n",
    "2. Allocate average daily demands at nodes; \n",
    "3. Determine the peak factors; \n",
    "4. Estimate fire demands; \n",
    "5. Project demands for future expansion of the service areas;\n",
    "6. Test design(s) using a hydraulic model;\n",
    "7. Choose a design that is feasible economically and hydraulically that satisfies end user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A node is considered a junction point in a system where a demand can be attributed/assigned.  \n",
    "> Models use the nodes to calculate the system demands, pressures, water quality, and velocity.  These items are usually prescribed in guidance documents with minimum/maximum acceptable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are used to test the design before commiting to a real-world build.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The practical design of a water system without the use of water distribution modeling software is possible, but requires a logical, economical approach of laying out the system (and some roll-your-own calculations). \n",
    "\n",
    "Professional quality software is inexpensive (free) so there is really no good reason to design a system without using a hydraulic model - hence the guidance documents almost expect a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial value-added software is usually far easier for a designer to use and integrated into other design tools, but is computationally about the same as free software \n",
    "> A designer should use commercial software when it is available to them, the time savings can more than justify the license costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Aided Design \n",
    "There are several pipe network analysis software (also called network simulation software, or hydraulic network modeling software) that mathematically solve hydraulic equations for all interconnections, branches and loops of the pipe network. With the advent of such powerful software, the conventional methods of water distribution design have been mostly discarded. The computer software requires the designer to create a water supply system model by inputting in the computer program information that includes pipe lengths, junctions or node elevations, connectivity of the pipes and nodes, demand in each node, information on pumps, elevations of reservoirs, elevations, and yield of sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the current software available on the web and from proprietary sources, the EPANET is often used. EPANET is public domain software developed by Water Supply and Water Resources Division (formerly the Drinking Water Research Division) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that can be downloaded for free on the internet. The software tracks the flow of water in each pipe, the pressure at each node, and the height of water in each tank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important features of EPANET for distribution network design is its ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle systems of any size;\n",
    "- Compute friction head loss using the Hazen-Williams, the Darcy Weisback, or the Chezy-Manning head loss formula;\n",
    "- Includes minor head losses for bends, fittings, etc.;\n",
    "- Models constant or variable speed pumps;\n",
    "- Allows storage tanks to have any shape;\n",
    "- Allows control rules to change valve settings in response to system hydraulics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design process using EPANET usually involves the (a) layout of the system configuration including locations of sources and storage facilities, (b) determination of the distribution of demands to the nodes, input of network data, running hydraulic simulation, viewing results in any of the variety of formats, modifying the model by editing the network data, and modifying the model until the design criteria are met or results are acceptable.

    "## Workflow for Distribution System Design Using Computer Software\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Base Mapping <br>Detailed maps of the project area should be gathered as a basis for pipeline alignment, distance and elevations. These should be obtained from field topographical surveys or certified suppliers of map products. For preliminary analyses, the Google Earth (http://earth.google.com) internet site which makes it possible to view and print aerial images of the area being designed may be used. <br><br> The information in the maps should be correlated to produce a base map, on which the proposed system layout will be drawn. The designer should conduct an visual inspection of the whole project area to verify, validate and update the information on the source maps. The resulting base map must include positions and information on roads, streets, rivers, creeks, elevations, topographic contours and locations of built-up areas. It should also provide relevant information like potential large consumers, e.g., swine and poultry farms. Ideally, the base map should be scaled to some useful coordinate reference system (WGS; UTM; ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Water Demand Projection <br> The average day demand for the design year will be the basis of the hydraulic network analysis. The demand condition will be varied by adjusting the demand factor; that is 1 for the average day demand condition, 1.3 for the maximum day demand and 2.5 â€“ 3 for the peak-hour demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tentative Layout <br> Using the base map, the designer should next develop a tentative layout of the pipe network, which should also show the positions of the source facilities and reservoir(s). Pipelines are to be laid on road right of way, and the network should cover the target consumers. Nodes are placed at locations for pipe junctions, street or road junctions and intersections, locations for water points, demand centres, and not more than 100 metres from the nearest node. In systems where it is expected that pressure will be generally low or fluctuating, nodes are placed at the highest points of the service area.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Distribution of Demands <br> It is important to plot the town or community boundaries and the service area delineation on the base map. Once the tentative layout (with nodes) is plotted on the base map, the service area should be sub-divided into node areas. This will give the designer a working idea of the respective number of houses within the area covered by each node.<br><br>The projected average day demand for the design year is distributed to all the nodes within its delineated service area. The distribution of demands should take into consideration the relative number of houses for the different node areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Encoding of Input Data <br> Most of the hydraulic analysis software have common input data requirements. These data are grouped into pipe data and node data. Pipe data are the assigned pipe number, pipe diameter (mm), C-value, the pipe nodes, and length (m). Node data are node number, elevation (m), and water demand (lps). Usually, the values of the design criteria are required by computer software.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Hydraulic Network Simulation <br> With all the data having been input by the designer, the software can proceed with its hydraulic run. The software computes the head losses (m) in each pipe, the rate of head loss (m/km) in each pipe, the flow velocities (m/s), and the pressure in each node (m).<br><br>The model is run for: (a) its peak-hour demand condition, to check for the minimum value of the pressure in the system; and (b) its minimum demand condition, to check for the value of the  maximum pressure in the network. <br><br> Operational simulations are then conducted to simulate a typical varying demand (hourly variation; ...) to identify min/max pressures, check operation rules, size pumps and storage elements, determine water age in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Examination of Hydraulic Run Results <br>Usually, all possible hydraulic parameters can be shown from the computer run results. Of these parameters, the designer must examine two important results very closely: (a) The low system pressure points that are below the prescribed minimum pressure and the affected nodes, and (b) the pipes that have high head loss per km in excess of pipeline criteria. <br><br>The designer must also examine the balancing flows of the reservoir and analyze if the reservoir discharge or inflow is reasonable for its storage size.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Adjusting Assumed Parameters of the Elements<br> Based on the results of the computer simulation, the designer will improve the network model by adjusting the pipe and node data for specific elements, particularly for those that did not meet the design criteria. For example, for pipes that have high resulting head losses, the designer will have to increase the pipe size to the next larger diameter. If there is a system pressure that is below the prescribed minimum, the designer could replace some of the pipes leading to the affected node with a larger diameter. The height of the reservoir could be adjusted if needed to achieve a good system pressure. <br><br>The adjusted model is run again in the software. After the run, the results are examined and the model readjusted. The above cycle is repeated until an acceptable hydraulic model is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Finalizing the Network Configuration<br> The model is subjected to repeated simulation and data adjustments until an acceptable network configuration is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Reporting Results <br> A modeling report is usually necessary to exlain the modeling findings, and final design and will usually accompany various permit and funding applications (i.e. construction, environmental, ...)"
