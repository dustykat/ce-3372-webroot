Quiz: Urban Stream Syndrome
Question 1

What is the primary driver of the urban stream syndrome?
A. Deforestation of riparian zones
B. Urban stormwater runoff and impervious surfaces
C. Agricultural runoff
D. Groundwater pumping

Answer: B. Urban stormwater runoff and impervious surfaces
Question 2

Which of the following is a consistent symptom of the urban stream syndrome?

B. Decreased channel complexity
C. Increased retention of organic matter
D. Reduced occurrence of high-flow events

Answer: B. Decreased channel complexity
Question 3

How does urbanization typically affect stream hydrographs?
A. Reduces the frequency of high-flow events
B. Makes streams less "flashy"
C. Leads to more frequent and larger flow events
D. Stabilizes peak flow rates

Answer: C. Leads to more frequent and larger flow events

D. Calcium

Answer: A. Nitrogen
Question 5

What is one effect of reduced baseflow in urban streams?
A. Improved water temperature stability
B. Increased dissolved oxygen levels
C. Increased diel variation in dissolved oxygen
D. Reduced sediment loads

Answer: C. Increased diel variation in dissolved oxygen
Question 6

What restoration strategy is unlikely to fully address urban stream syndrome on its own?
A. Dispersed stormwater treatment
B. End-of-pipe stormwater treatment
C. Riparian revegetation
D. Integrated urban stream management

Answer: B. End-of-pipe stormwater treatment
Question 7

What is a common shift observed in the biotic composition of urban streams?
A. Increased abundance of sensitive fish species
B. Dominance by tolerant macroinvertebrates and species-poor assemblages
C. Increased abundance of shredder macroinvertebrates
D. Replacement of diatoms with cyanobacteria

Answer: B. Dominance by tolerant macroinvertebrates and species-poor assemblages
Question 8

What role do riparian forests play in mitigating urban stream syndrome?
A. They reduce channel incision and stabilize banks.
B. They prevent urban runoff entirely.
C. They increase flashiness in hydrographs.
D. They eliminate all stormwater pollutants.

Answer: A. They reduce channel incision and stabilize banks.
Question 9

How does the presence of impervious surfaces connected to streams affect urban stream health?
A. It improves habitat complexity.
B. It accelerates pollutant delivery and reduces water infiltration.
C. It reduces the likelihood of eutrophication.
D. It increases organic matter storage.

Answer: B. It accelerates pollutant delivery and reduces water infiltration.
Question 10

What is a critical component of successful urban stream restoration?
A. Focus solely on instream habitat enhancement
B. Address social, economic, and ecological factors
C. Implement universal solutions across all urban areas
D. Ignore human behaviors and attitudes

Answer: B. Address social, economic, and ecological factors
