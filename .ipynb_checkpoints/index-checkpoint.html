           <p><strong>3372. Water Systems Design (3:3:0)</strong>.
Prerequesites: CE 3305, 3354. Hydraulic analysis and design of municipal
 water distribution, stormwater collection,
and wastewater collection systems. Oral and written presentations. (Communications Intensive)

        <button class="accordion">Description</button>
        <div class="panel">
<p> The course reviews theory and application of hydraulics, 
demonstrates the use of predictive tools such as charts and computer programs, and apply these tools to the
analysis and design of distribution and collection and pumping systems. Preparation of
reports and designs and presentations are additional components of this course. </br>




1. Read, synthesize, and communicate ideas presented in current and historical technical
literature. </br>

2. Perform 
flow and transport computation in simplistic topologies using Excel, or R as
needed.</br>
3. Perform 
flow and transport computation in realistic geometries using EPA-NET or
similar professional tools for water distribution systems.</br>
4. Perform 
flow and transport computation in realistic geometries using SWMM 5.0 or
similar professional tools for stormwater and wastewater collection systems. </br>
5. Size and select engineering materials (pipes, pumps, valves, etc.) for use in drinking
water (water distribution), stormwater , and wastewater systems.</br>
6. Prepare preliminary engineering design reports for a drinking water distribution system, a
stormwater collection system, and a wastewater collection system.

	This junior level course requires sucessful completion of CE 3305 (fluid mechanics) or 
equivalent, CE 3354 (engineering hydrology) or equivalent.
Students will synthesize and apply computing skills from ENGR 1315 or ENGR 1330 and EGR 1207.

On-line compute environments are provided for this course which are accessed through the navigation bar links.  
WCOE has adopted JupyterLab as a preferred computing environment within ENGR 1330, in the spirit of
downstream application of Computational Thinking/Data Science
components of this course are being transitioned to that environment.
A shared JupyterLab computing environment (<strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong> enabled) is also provided through a navigation bar link. </br></br>
Network simulations will be conducted using EPANET 2.2 and SWMM 5.0 which are available for free from
the US EPA website, or you can use the <strong>EPANET in a Box</strong> and <strong>SWMM in a Box</strong> shared environments.</br></br>
<!--<a href="http://atomickitty.ddns.net/wordpress/software/"> Macintosh application bundles </a> are available from the instructor's website.
These are 32-bit bundles; they will work with MacOS Mojave (10.14.6).
They will NOT work on the 64-bit MacOS Catalina (10.15).
