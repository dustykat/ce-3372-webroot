# ce3372-psuedo-course
Water Systems Design - webroot image, used for LTS maintenance and instructor sharing

## Notes
1.  Contains excerpts of copyright materials, mostly in the readings collection. Use care when placing on a webserver - consider .htaccess control, weak passwords seems to fit the spirit of fair use in US Copyright Code.
2.  This repository is an image of a website, intent is to load into a directory on your webroot. Current structure is `http://webroot/ce-3372-psuedo-course/... `
3.  Links to on-line calculators will point to my server unless changed.
4.  Need to check video links for Lesson1-Lesson10, changed links mid-term
