 An EPA-NET simulation model for a reservoir-pump-network was constructed and operated for four (4) different operational scenarios.   Figure \ref{fig:epa-net-map-gpm} is a depiction of the network.   The numbers next to the nodes are Node\_ID values in the reports that follow, and the numbers next to the pipes are the Link\_ID values.  The network is supplied from a reservoir through a booster pump, both are depicted on Figure \ref{fig:epa-net-map-gpm}.

\item (30 pts) Figures \ref{fig:waterQ1},\ref{fig:waterQ2}, and \ref{fig:waterQ3} are screen captures of an EPANET extended period simulation for water quality in a pipeline distribution network.
The chemical parameter of interest is Chloramine.  Interpret the figures to answer the following questions: ~\\
\begin{enumerate}[A)]
\item What is the Chloramine value (dosage) in the supply reservoir? \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
\item What is the simulation time, in hours, of the first arrival of chloramine to Node 6? \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
\item What is the distance, in feet, from the supply reservoir to Node 6 along the path that involves Link 11 $->$ Link 1 $->$ Link 4 $->$ Link 7? \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
\item What is the travel time, in hours, along the path above? (Show your calculations) \\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
