A storm sewer (reinforced concrete pipe) is 400-feet long and 30-inches in diameter.  The sewer flows from a junction box (invert elevation $101.00$ feet) to a lift station sump (invert elevation $100.00$ feet).  Assuming Manning's roughness coefficient is $0.015$ for all flow depths, the sewer maximum flow capacity without surcharge is about\footnote{For partial credit show work}

An EPA-NET simulation model for a reservoir-pump-network was constructed and operated for four (4) different operational scenarios.   Figure \ref{fig:epa-net-map} is a depiction of the network.   The numbers next to the nodes are Node\_ID values in the reports that follow, and the numbers next to the pipes are the Link\_ID values.  The network is supplied from a reservoir through a booster pump, both are depicted on Figure \ref{fig:epa-net-map}.
