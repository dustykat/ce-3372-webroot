\item Figure \ref{fig:PumpPlantPicture} is a collection of annotated images of the Edmonston Pumping Plant and pipeline/tunnel system at the southern end of the California Aqueduct.  The 10+ mile system lifts water from the Edmonston forebay at elevation 1239 feet to the Tehachapi afterbay at elevation 3131 feet for subsequent distribution to various parts of southern California.

Figure %\ref{fig:pumpcurve} 
is a pump performance curve for one of the 14 pumps arranged in two 7-pump bays, each supplying one of the parallel 16-foot diameter steel pressure pipes.
