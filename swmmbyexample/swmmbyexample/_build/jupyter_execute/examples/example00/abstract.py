# # Abstract
# 
# A trivial example that shows how to access SWMM from a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection.  To run the example you must have an internet connection (faster is better) and the remote must be up and running (that's an AWS issue, in general if AWS is not running, you cannot buy anything on Amazon).
